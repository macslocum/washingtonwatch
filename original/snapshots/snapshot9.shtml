<h2>State of the Nation</h2>

70% of respondents say that the country is on the wrong track. 20% say the country is on the right track. This is the highest “wrong track” number found by the NBC/WSJ since August 2014. [NBC/WSJ 12/9]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

75% of Americans are dissatisfied with the way the nation is being governed and 69% are at least somewhat angry with the way things are going in the U.S.
<br><br>
There is little difference between men and women or by age as to the level of dissatisfaction. Those who live in the Midwest (82% dissatisfied) and in rural areas (80% dissatisfied) are somewhat more dissatisfied than those who live in the rest of the country.
<br><br>
While 92% of Republicans are dissatisfied with the way we are being governed, only 59% of Democrats hold that view.
<br><br>
97% of those who support Trump are dissatisfied with the direction of the country and 91% are at least somewhat angry with the direction of the country. [CNN/ORC 12/21]

<h2>President Obama</h2>

In late December, President Obama’s approval rating among those 18 years and older was at 44% in Gallup and 41% in Reuters. His disapproval rating was 52% and 51% respectively. [Gallup and Reuters 12/30/15]
<br><br>
Here are other approval scores going back 3 years.

What it means I do not know, but so far it appears that Donald Trump is the only candidate for President in 2016 who has a coloring book produced in his honor. I received my copy from my friend Mike in San Francisco.
<br><br>
THE TRUMP COLORING BOOK contains a series of drawings of Trump as various historical and current figures, and in various places. The book, by M.G. Anthony, is published by Post Hill Press of New York, and is available on Amazon for $10.51.

The following are a series of charts that provide basic information about the 2016 election and the candidates.

2. Select national polls

<br><br>
4. The money
<br><br>
5. Primary/caucus dates and state delegate numbers and allocation
<br><br>
6. The Primary Debates

<h2>1. The current list of candidates</h2>

And then there were 12. 12 is the number of candidates still seeking the Republican nomination for President. George Pataki was the fifth Republican to abandon the race.
<br><br>
Three Democrats continue to seek the Democratic nomination. Three others have abandoned the race.
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h2>5. Primary/Caucus dates and state delegate numbers and allocation</h2>

Included are the number of delegates assigned to each Party in each State and how the delegates will be allocated. The DNC mandates a proportional allocation for all States. The RNC allows States more flexibility.
<br><br>
Definitions for Republican Allocation of Delegates:
<br><br>
<em>Conv</em>: State will bind delegates to the national convention at a State/territory convention. Other conventions will leave the delegation unbound.
<br><br>
<em>Prop</em>: State will proportionally allocate delegates based either on the Statewide primary/caucus vote or on the combination of the Statewide and Congressional district votes.
<br><br>
<em>Prop w/Trigger</em>: State will follow above proportional rules, but allows for a winner-take-all allocation if a candidate wins a majority of the vote Statewide or at the Congressional district level.
<br><br>
<em>Hybrid</em>: State will follow some form of winner-take-most plan (i.e., winner-take- all by Congressional district) or directly elects delegates on the primary ballot.
<br><br>
<em>Winner-take-all</em>: State will award all delegates to the plurality winner of the primary or caucus.
<br><br>
