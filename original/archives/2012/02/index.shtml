<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

If incumbent Massachusetts Republican Senator Scott Brown loses his bid for re-election, the Republican caucus in the Senate will bear considerable responsibility. Had the Republicans not stopped the President from nominating Elizabeth Warren to head the new consumer protection agency she would not be the Democratic nominee in Massachusetts. In the most recent public surveys, Warren is now leading Brown.
<br><br>
A second weak spot for the Republicans is Nevada, where appointed Senator Dean Heller is, at best, running even with Democratic Congressperson Shelly Berkeley.
<br><br>
While loss of either of these States will make it difficult for the Republicans to take control of the Senate, the loss of both seats would seem to make the job all but impossible.

<strong>The U.S. Senate</strong>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 51</li>
  <li> Republicans 47</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>

Here is how the 33 Senate elections made up of 23 Democratic incumbents (including 2 Independents) and 10 Republican incumbents look to me at this time . (D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP incumbent in office, I=Ind. Incumbent in office) Underlining reflects retirement.

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

While the Democrats have a lot going for them in the fall elections and prospects for a pickup of seats by the Democrats is high, at least for now, a take over of the House by the Democrats appears not likely.
<br><br>
WW has regularly reprinted the “House Dashboard” published by the Cook Political Report. The data from January 20, 2011 is from the Dashboard. However, the Dashboard is not being published at this time because of the uncertainties caused by re-districting. Therefore, the chart below (other than 1/20/11) reflects the Cook’s current Competitive House Race Chart through February 9, 2012 . [As always, thanks to “The Cook Political Report.” ]

12 States were seen as solidly Democratic politically in 2011, down from 30
States which were described that way in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected. An additional 7 States were described as lean-Democratic, about the same number as 2008. The number of States described as solidly Republican has grown over the same period from 4 to 10. and the number of lean-Republican States has grown from 1 to 7. Truly competitive States have grown from 10 to 15.

The number of those who describe themselves as supporters of the Tea Party Movement has not grown over the last year, with 27% expressing that view in January of both 2011 and 2012. The number who describe themselves as not supporting the movement has grown slightly to 66%. [NBC/WSJ 1/12]

From the point of view of the President’s re-election effort, the scenarios remain the same. If the election is a referendum on Obama he has a problem. If it is a contest between himself and the Republican nominee, his prospects are improving. And, should he have the good fortune of being able to make the election a referendum on the Republican nominee, he is on his way to a good victory. Recent statements and actions of the Republican nominees make the possibility of the latter slightly better.
<br><br>
Obama’s team must also be listening with a certain pleasure to those in the Republican Party who talk of a brokered convention. It is hard to imagine the type of campaign that would be put together by a nominee who was not certain he would be in the general election until the Thursday before Labor Day, two months before the election.
<br><br>
But it is important not to forget that all that goes on now is, in fact, preliminary. More likely than not, the Republicans will have a nominee long before their convention and before a whole new cluster of voters begin to pay real attention to the election.

Just how much money will the Obama campaign be able to raise? For months commentators have talked about the campaign raising $1 billion. The Obama campaign has been assiduous in calling that talk crazy.
<br><br>
The campaign collected $130 million in 2011. This is a substantial amount, but that leaves $870 million to be raised in order to reach the $1 billion mark. This money would have to be raised in time to be used in the campaign, which effectively means by the 1st of October. That means the campaign would have to take in <strong>$96.6</strong> million each month. Short of simply passing out dollars, most high cost campaign activity requires advance planning and reservation. The Obama campaign announced on February 17th that the campaign and the DNC had raised <strong>$29.1</strong> million together in January. The campaign share was only $11.8 million (NYT).
<br><br>
Of course these numbers do not take into account the amounts that will be raised by the Democratic National Committee and Priorities USA, the super Pac established to support his re-election.
<br><br>
Obama has changed his tune when it comes to “acknowledgement and support” of the Super PAC created to support his candidacy.
<br><br>
Given the relatively modest amount that the PAC raised in 2011, $4.4 million, it was clear that Obama was going to have to do something if the PAC was going to be of value in the coming election.
<br><br>
And so, while claiming that he opposed the whole idea of Super PACs, the President did what was necessary to signal that he wanted wealthy Democratic donors to play beyond their contributions to his campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Others announced that he had agreed that Cabinet members , senior White House officials, and campaign staffers were free to participate in the Super PAC’s ongoing efforts.
<br><br>
The President’s new position was inevitable. No one believed that the two ex-White House staffers who started Priorities USA did it without at least the implicit approval of the President. However, without his acknowledgement of its importance, it would not have met its goals or the broader campaign’s needs.

<br><br>
At least for now, this is a race between Santorum and Romney. Paul and Gingrich are, for practical purposes, out of the race.
<br><br>
Paul and Gingrich both retain significant followings, but they are not showing any growth. Paul has no prospect for real growth. It remains an open question whether Gingrich can rise again between now and the end of Super Tuesday, March 6th. Given the nature of the Paul and Gingrich supporters, Romney must hope that they stay in the race for some period of time. While not all of their supporters would go to Santorum if either or both end their campaigns, on balance, Santorum would be the primary beneficiary.
<br><br>
There are many things that define the differences between Santorum and Romney.
<br><br>
Santorum has a core set of beliefs and values that are the basis for the philosophical aspects of his campaign. You may not agree with him, and some of the things he believes may seem to be pretty fringy, but his positions have not been created for the purpose of this campaign. When faced with a new question he can quickly express an answer that is consistent with those core beliefs and values. He rarely, if ever tries to shade his responses.
<br><br>
Romney appears to be the polar opposite. He may well have a set of beliefs and values, but it is hard to find them, and they are not the core from which his positions spring forth. When faced with a new question, he must first recall the substantive framework that has been created for his campaign, and then come up with an answer. He often shades.
<br><br>
In short, Santorum is if nothing else, authentic. Romney is not.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Santorum should also be credited with designing a campaign plan based on what is possible for him. In short, he has gone to places where he can get votes on the cheap. That is to say, since he did not have unlimited resources, he spent his time in locations where his personal appearances and a modest amount of organization can result in “victories” which keep him on the path to nomination.
<br><br>
Since his first election to the House of Representatives, and continuing into his current campaign, Santorum has had the strategic assistance of a Pennsylvania consultant, John Brabender. Brabender is apparently particularly adroit at crafting appeals to Catholics and working class people.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Romney faces what could be another embarrassment in Michigan. Who would have thought that he would be challenged in what is his original “home” State? The position which he took, critical of the Obama administration’s effort to save General Motors and Chrysler, did not and is not going over well. He is now trying hard to explain how what the Administration did was effectively to follow his suggestion. But few, if any, are buying his newly coined version of history.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Donald Trump has struck again. Trump decided to announce that he was supporting Romney for the Republican nomination. He chose to do it in Nevada, in a fancy hotel, at exactly the time that Romney was facing challenges relating to his wealth. He noted that millions of people were interested in who he would support. It is worth noting that following that endorsement, Romney lost the next three events on the Republican nomination schedule.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

There is a lot of chatter about the amount of money being spent on the primary campaign, much of which is coming from the treasuries of the Super Pacs. But the amounts of money spent by or on behalf of candidates through the end of 2011 suggest that money may not be the end all that it is often considered to be.
<br><br>
The amounts of money spent during January are not yet available. But, they are likely to be substantial. However, here is the raising and spending by select candidates, and the Super Pacs supporting them, in the millions. Remember there were no delegate contests before January.

<br><br>
So, by the time of the Iowa Caucuses, won by Santorum (if only by a hair), Romney had spent $37.2 million from his own campaign coffers and Santorum had spent only $1.9 million. Of course, Romney was spending on States down the road, as well as in Iowa, but even so, his spending over Santorum’s was substantial.

                                 Barack Obama is not a typical politician or President. He eschews the usual touchy-feely aspects of the political dance. In many ways he is inscrutable. He is described by many as a loner. The number of Members of Congress who talk about never being in contact with the President is legion. And he certainly is not a back-slapper. In short, he seems to see himself as above the traditional expectations we have of Presidential behavior.
<br><br>
On the other hand, he has proven himself to be a timely decision maker in difficult situations. He seems to know what he thinks and why he thinks it. He has not allowed himself to be labeled as a “liberal” or a “moderate,” giving himself leeway to vary as circumstances dictate. And, there is no doubt that he is a fighter.
<br><br>
Later this year we will find out whether the public at large buys his incarnation of the Presidency.

Americans are split three ways on whether Obama has brought “the right kind of change” to the country or any change at all to the country. As you recall, “change” is what he promised in the 2008 campaign.
<br><br>
35% say he has brought the right kind of change
<br><br>
32% say he has brought the wrong kind of change

With 8-1/2 months to go before the general election, the public’s grade for the job he has done so far is lower than that of six previous Presidents, and above one, at this point in their first term.
<br><br>
The President’s current job approval rating in Gallup is 46%. The following is the list of 8.

By 47% to 38%, Americans disapprove of the job that Obama has done in creating jobs for them. 54% disapproved in January 2011. [CBS/NYT 2/12]

By 47% to 37%, adults believe that President Obama is more likely than Congressional Republicans to offer tax and spending proposals that reflect their own priorities. [UT/NJ Connection Poll 2/12]
<br><br>
There has been only the slightest droop in the approval of Catholics for President Obama following the dust up with the Catholic Church hierarchy over making contraception available to workers at Catholic institutions, like hospitals and schools. Churches are exempt.
<br><br>
Polls also show that approval by Catholics mirrors the population at large, and there is no difference between those who attend church weekly and those who go less often. [Gallup 2/12]

However, 50% of the public at large disapproves of the new policy, even though 81% of the public at large, including 77% of Catholics, do not think that using artificial means of birth control is wrong. [CNN/ORC 2/12]

37.7 million people, on 14 different networks, watched President Obama’s 2012 State of the Union Address to the Congress, January 24th. The audience was down from 42.7 million viewers in 2011 and 48 million viewers in 2010.

                                 When I began absorbing political surveys the highest state-of-the-art method had polltakers going door-to-door, having direct one-on-one conversations with respondents.
<br><br>
Over time that changed, and the highest state-of-the-art method became and still is the telephone survey, with a direct one-on-one conversation between a questioner sitting in a phone bank and a respondent. Until recent years, those telephone conversations were on landlines. Now, because of the number of people who only use cell phones, a proper sample includes cell phones as well as landlines.
<br><br>
Various techniques have been designed for creating random samples that are likely to approximate a particular group. That group might be all adults, only those who are currently registered, or only those who say they are likely to vote in the election that is the focus of the survey.
<br><br>
Over the last few years, a number of polls and polling organizations have come into play that use a variety of “new” techniques whose “efficacy” remains to be seen. These include wholly automatic telephone surveys and on-line surveys.
<br><br>
The moral of the story is that, when considering survey research, published or private, you need to take into account the methodology used in conducting the research. This is especially true when the result is out of whack with other surveys of the same group during roughly the same time period.
<br><br>
The following are items to which you might pay attention when evaluating a survey:
<br><br>
* Is it conducted online and, if so, how does it purport to create a random sample? Random samples can be developed online when the universe is fixed, for example when surveying the membership of an organization for which the email addresses of the members are available. Otherwise, no good device yet seems obvious.
<br><br>
* Is it conducted among registered voters or likely voters, and how close is it to the election? Likely voters makes more sense closer to election day.
<br><br>
* What is the size and nature of the sample? Is it smaller than the sample of other polls surveying the same landscape? Small samples often result in less than reliable results.
<br><br>
* Are all potential participants included in the sample? Nate Silver cited an example of a survey taken for a primary election that did not include Independents when they are free to participate in the partisan primary.
<br><br>
* If it is a telephone survey, are an appropriate number of cell phone respondents included?
<br><br>
* Is it clear as to the time period in which the survey was conducted, as opposed to the time at which it is published?
<br><br>
* Is information about the survey methodology, sample size, and timing of the survey prominently displayed with the results?

There are a number of aggregators of national and State surveys. They provide an invaluable service, making it unnecessary for consumers of this kind of data to scour various sources for the latest information.
<br><br>
However, to the extent that such services calculate an average number for some time period, there is a need to pay attention to which surveys are included in the average.
<br><br>
An average that includes with equal weight a survey taken by NBC/WSJ and an automated telephone survey that does not include cell phones needs to be viewed and used with care.

When considering comparisons of survey results from different time periods it is important to remain mindful of the context.
<br><br>
As the election approaches, one of the popular comparisons is the relevance, of a sitting President’s job approval to the prospects of re-election. The test seems to be whether the incumbent President is at or above the 50% mark. Of course, George W. Bush was reelected with a 48% approval rating. And, there have been only 11 Presidents who sought re-election since the advent of polling. It is not much of a sample, but it is all there is.
<br><br>
In a recent Washington Post article about the Democrats’ prospects for retaking the House, the writer makes the point that the Republicans have had a margin of this size 5 times since 1900. Each time they had huge losses in the next election. To the credit of the writer the article goes on to make the point that the Republicans have not had a margin of this size since the 1940. A lot has changed since then. [WP 2/7/12]

When it comes to the primary source of campaign news, cable news leads the way. This is where Americans follow campaigns and candidates. Notable is the drop in local TV news, network news, and local newspapers, and the increase in the internet.

Facebook and Twitter are not yet significant online sources of campaign- related information. 6% regularly turn to Facebook, while only 2% regularly turn to Twitter. Only 6% of Facebook/Twitter users say they have become a “friend” to a candidate on a social networking site. However, this is up from 3% in 2008.
<br><br>
The average Facebook user makes seven new Facebook friends each month. On average, Facebook users can reach more than 150,000 Facebook users through friends.
<br><br>
The top online sources used regularly by 20 % are websites and the apps of print, TV and radio organizations.
<br><br>
The top online sources for campaign news are CNN and Yahoo/Yahoo News.

Fox News is cited by far more Republicans than Democrats as the place they get most of the campaign news. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to prefer CNN and MSNBC.
<br><br>
67% (37% great deal/30% fair amount) say there is a great deal of political bias in news reporting. This includes 49% of Republicans and 32% of Democrats.
<br><br>
While we are only in the early stages of the 2012 presidential campaign, 72% of registered voters say they have seen or heard campaign commercials.

This change is mirrored in the most recent CNN/ORC survey, in which 60% said that things are going badly in the country, down from the 70% recorded two months earlier. 40% say things are going at least fairly well, up from the 30%, recorded two months earlier. [2/12]

37% of Americans think the economy will get better over the next 12 months. This is the most positive number found by the NBC/WSJ since January 2011, when 40% had that view. Conversely, the number who are pessimistic about the future has also dropped to the year-ago level of 17%. [1/12]

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an unemployment rate of 8.3% in the month of January. This represents a continuing drop on this most vivid of numbers.
<br><br>
Gallup came up with a slightly higher number of 8.6% for the same period, a slight increase from the previous month. It also reported an increase to 10.1% (from 9.8%) in the number of people who are working part-time, but want full- time employment. Thus, a total of 18.7% are considered to be unemployed.
<br><br>
Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, Florida, and California had the highest underemployment rates in 2011, at least 21%. Two States, North and South Dakota, had underemployment rates of 12%, the lowest in the country.
<br><br>
[Note: this still undercounts the real unemployment rate because neither test includes those who have stopped looking for work. ]
<br><br>
* Confidence in the U.S. economy has gone up for five months through January. It is now a minus 27, up from a minus 52.
<br><br>
* 36% think the economy is getting better, up from a low of 18% in the summer of 2011. The high point in the last four years was in January 2011, when it hit 41%.
<br><br>
* 83% are dissatisfied with the state of the nation’s economy, and 69% are dissatisfied with the size and power of the Federal government.
<br><br>
* 49% see themselves as worse off today than they were a year ago.
<br><br>
* 49% say the U.S. economic system is unfair, but 62% say that the system is fair to them.
<br><br>
* 36% worry about losing their job in the next year. 51% worry about maintaining their standard of living, while 43% fear they will not be able to pay medical bills. [Gallup]

On February 15th, Gallup published the results of a survey of small business owners. The headline said, “Health Costs, Gov’t Regulations Curb Small Business Hiring.” And then there was a sub-headline that read, “Nearly half of small- business owners name those issues.” All of the above is accurate based on the report of the survey.
<br><br>
It is not until you get into the report that you discover that yes, 48% are worried about the potential cost of healthcare and 46% are worried about government regulations, but those issues rank 5th and 6th in the list of concerns expressed by small business owners.
<br><br>
76% Don’t need any additional employees at this time
<br><br>
71% Worried revenues or sales won’t justify adding employees 
<br><br>
66% Worry about the current status of the U.S. economy
<br><br>
53% Worry about cash flow or ability to make payroll
<br><br>
Then come concerns about healthcare and government regulations.

66% of adults believe there are “strong or very strong” conflicts between rich and poor, an increase of nearly 20% in the last two years. Across the political spectrum this view is held by 55% of Republicans, 68% of Independent, and 73% of Democrats.
<br><br>
43% believe that rich people attained that status mainly because of “hard work, ambition or education.” 46% think that wealthy people became rich primarily because of “knowing the right people or being born into wealthy families.” [PEW]

In various forms, the poor in America have been a topic of conversation in this election season. Notably, about 25% of Republicans and Republican-leaning registered voters have annual family incomes of less than $30,000. 57% of that population think that the government does too little for poor people. 21% think the government does about the right amount.

<br><br>

54% believe that “high unemployment has left more people in need of government assistance.”
<br><br>
38% do not believe that the safety net is sufficient for those who need help “just to get by.” [UT/NJ Connection Poll 2/12]

<br><br>
77% of Democrats and 71% of Republicans also agree that the U.S. should do more to pressure China to allow fairer trade with this country. But that is where agreement seems to end.
<br><br>
* 84% of Democrats, but only 46% of Republicans, think the Federal government should spend more to support development of alternative energy sources.
<br><br>
* A majority of Republicans -- 54% -- think the Federal government should spend more on education and job training for the long term unemployed. 93% of Democrats hold this view.
