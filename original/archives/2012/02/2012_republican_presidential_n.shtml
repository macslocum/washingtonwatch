<br><br>
At least for now, this is a race between Santorum and Romney. Paul and Gingrich are, for practical purposes, out of the race.
<br><br>
Paul and Gingrich both retain significant followings, but they are not showing any growth. Paul has no prospect for real growth. It remains an open question whether Gingrich can rise again between now and the end of Super Tuesday, March 6th. Given the nature of the Paul and Gingrich supporters, Romney must hope that they stay in the race for some period of time. While not all of their supporters would go to Santorum if either or both end their campaigns, on balance, Santorum would be the primary beneficiary.
<br><br>
There are many things that define the differences between Santorum and Romney.
<br><br>
Santorum has a core set of beliefs and values that are the basis for the philosophical aspects of his campaign. You may not agree with him, and some of the things he believes may seem to be pretty fringy, but his positions have not been created for the purpose of this campaign. When faced with a new question he can quickly express an answer that is consistent with those core beliefs and values. He rarely, if ever tries to shade his responses.
<br><br>
Romney appears to be the polar opposite. He may well have a set of beliefs and values, but it is hard to find them, and they are not the core from which his positions spring forth. When faced with a new question, he must first recall the substantive framework that has been created for his campaign, and then come up with an answer. He often shades.
<br><br>
In short, Santorum is if nothing else, authentic. Romney is not.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Santorum should also be credited with designing a campaign plan based on what is possible for him. In short, he has gone to places where he can get votes on the cheap. That is to say, since he did not have unlimited resources, he spent his time in locations where his personal appearances and a modest amount of organization can result in “victories” which keep him on the path to nomination.
<br><br>
Since his first election to the House of Representatives, and continuing into his current campaign, Santorum has had the strategic assistance of a Pennsylvania consultant, John Brabender. Brabender is apparently particularly adroit at crafting appeals to Catholics and working class people.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Romney faces what could be another embarrassment in Michigan. Who would have thought that he would be challenged in what is his original “home” State? The position which he took, critical of the Obama administration’s effort to save General Motors and Chrysler, did not and is not going over well. He is now trying hard to explain how what the Administration did was effectively to follow his suggestion. But few, if any, are buying his newly coined version of history.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Donald Trump has struck again. Trump decided to announce that he was supporting Romney for the Republican nomination. He chose to do it in Nevada, in a fancy hotel, at exactly the time that Romney was facing challenges relating to his wealth. He noted that millions of people were interested in who he would support. It is worth noting that following that endorsement, Romney lost the next three events on the Republican nomination schedule.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

There is a lot of chatter about the amount of money being spent on the primary campaign, much of which is coming from the treasuries of the Super Pacs. But the amounts of money spent by or on behalf of candidates through the end of 2011 suggest that money may not be the end all that it is often considered to be.
<br><br>
The amounts of money spent during January are not yet available. But, they are likely to be substantial. However, here is the raising and spending by select candidates, and the Super Pacs supporting them, in the millions. Remember there were no delegate contests before January.

<br><br>
So, by the time of the Iowa Caucuses, won by Santorum (if only by a hair), Romney had spent $37.2 million from his own campaign coffers and Santorum had spent only $1.9 million. Of course, Romney was spending on States down the road, as well as in Iowa, but even so, his spending over Santorum’s was substantial.
