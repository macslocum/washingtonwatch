<h1>Flying Fig</h1>
2523 Market Avenue<br>
Cleveland, Ohio<br>
216-241-4243</div>Debbie and I went to the Flying Fig for dinner with Jimmy, Suzie, Roland, Judy, Zack, and Debbie (another Debbie) for dinner.
<br><br>
As you enter the relatively narrow restaurant, the greeting station is immediately to the left and there is an "L" shaped bar to the left with 13 tall tools. Just past the greeting station there are several small booths ranging from two to four people, and then in the remainder of that room and an attached room there are tables, for 2, 4, 6 and 8. These tables can also be configured for parties of even greater number. We were seated in the main dining area. There is a window on the kitchen in the second smaller dining room. The restaurant is relatively dark, and on this particular evening was quite noisy, although we could easily hear each other.
<br><br>
Overall the restaurant seats 80 people for dinner and an additional 40 outside on a sidewalk patio.
<br><br>
According to the serving person, the menu changes from day to day. However, when WW compared the sample menu that is posted on line, dated August 2012, it is primarily the same as we received at our table in September. For example, the peach salad which was on the August menu was no longer on the September menu...I assume because they were just about out of season. There was on the August menu Tea Hills Farm Chicken Breast and Thigh, and on our menu the offering was Tea Hills Farm Chicken Paillard.
<br><br>
Plates of onion bread were delivered to the table and a whole lot of cross tasting was the order of the evening.
<br><br>
We started by sharing a series of "small starts": Daily Bruschetta, House Made Toppings, Buratta Cheese with Olive Tepenade, Arugula, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Sea Salt, Crostini; 2 orders of Tempura Battered Green Beans, Ponzu Sauce and Pineapple Caramel; Crispy Calamari & Rock Shrimp Tossed with Chillies, Scallions, Spiced Seat Salt, Pickled Carrots, Arugula, and Lemon Aioli; and Roasted Local Shishito Peppers stuffed with Sausage; Local Beet Salad with Pickled Beets, Whipped Cloverton, 6 minute egg, Pistachios, Multigrain Croutons, Lucky's Honey Vinaigrette.
<br><br>
For main courses the selections were: Jimmy, the Mahi Mahi special; Judy, Herbed Ricotta Gnocchi Confit Chicken, Killbuck Valley Mushrooms, Local Chard, Scallions, Haricot Vert, Herbs; Suzie, Tea Hills Farm Chicken Paillard, Warm Salad of German Butterball Potatoes, Tongues of Fire Beans, Swiss Chard, Local Red Pepper Coulis; Zack, Debbie, Rolland, Bourbon Glazed Short Rib Potato & Swiss Chard Cake, Smoke Provolone, Crispy Onion Rings; Debbie, Grilled Hanger Steak, Chile Rub, Gremolata Potatoes, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Cherry Tomatoes, Local Onions, Arugala; Mike, Seared Duck Breast, Mustard Spaetzle, Caramelized Onion, Carrots, Arugula Port-Dried Cherry Reduction.
<br><br>
The shared desserts were Warm Molten Chocolate Cake, Kahlua Syrup, Chocolate Ganache, Fig Ice Cream; Angel Food Cake, Peaches, Rasberries, Autumn Strawberries, and Apple Cobler with Vanilla Ice Cream.
<br><br>
Portion sizes seemed about right for an average person.
<br><br>
The entire men's restroom has a greenish hue, the walls, and even the large tiles on the floor are shade of green. As you enter there is a marble counter with two white ceramic washbasins. Then there is a wall and a single white ceramic wall hanging urinal. To the right of that appliance is a black metal wall commode closet, open at the top and bottom, and a single white ceramic commode. The whole place has a nice feel.
<br><br>
Dress is casual, valet parking seems to be a necessity and reservations are generally required. The chef-owner is Karen Small. The restaurant is known for being very much a part of the farm-to-table restaurant movement.

<br><br>
Three of those governorships are currently held by Republicans in Indiana, North Dakota, and Utah. These seats will stay in Republican hands.
<br><br>
Five of the governorships are held by Democrats. 2 of those seats will likely remain in Democratic hands, Missouri and West Virginia. 1 seat in North Carolina is likely to be won by the Republican.
<br><br>
Three of the seats, Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington, are too close to call at this time.

                                 In the 2nd half of October 21% approve of the job being done by Congress. This is an up ticket from mid-September, when 13% were positive.
<br><br>
It is not clear to what extent votes cast in the Presidential contest affect voting behavior down the ballot for the Senate, the House, or for State and local offices.

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Democrats 51</li>
  <li> Republicans 47</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>


Control of the Senate appears to depend on the races in Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Virginia.
<br><br>
Since the last Watch the following changes have occurred. Hawaii and Missouri have moved from TossUp to Leaning Democrat, and Pennsylvania has moved from Safe Democrat to Leaning Democrat. Virginia has moved from Leaning Democrat to TossUp.
<br><br>
Among the Toss Ups, 4 are currently held by Republicans and 5 are held by Democrats.
<br><br>
Assuming that Safe and Leaning Democratic seats end up that way after election day, the Democrats need to win 3 of the Toss Up States to have an actual majority, or 2 to gain a majority with the vote of the Vice President (assuming Obama is re-elected).
<br><br>
The prospects for the Democrats to retain control of the Senate regardless of the outcome of the Presidential campaign have improved.
<br><br>
Here is how the 33 Senate elections, made up of 23 Democratic incumbents (including 2 Independents) and 10 Republican incumbents, look to me at this time. (D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP incumbent in office, I=Ind. incumbent in office. Italics reflects retirement.)

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

Continued Republican control of the House is not in doubt. On the face of the current composition of the body, it would appear to require 25 new Democratic members for that Party to regain control. In fact, since up to 10 sitting Democrats may lose their seats, the real number is closer to 35. That is not realistic. The Democrats might pick up a net 5 or 6 seats.
<br><br>
By 45% to 43%, registered voters say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district if the election was held today. This is identical to the preference reflected in the December 2011 NBC/WS, but not as partial to Democrats as the preference reflected as recently as August 2012, when Democrats were preferred by 47% to 42%.
<br><br>
Of particular importance to incumbents generally, for the first time in the NBC/WSJ survey since October 2004, registered voters, by 44% to 41%, say that their representative deserves to be re-elected.

Here are five conservative and five liberal Super PACs that have been particularly active. Most of their spending will be directed to Congressional campaigns.

Americans continue to rate Obama negatively on the economy, with 52% disapproving and 46% approving. On foreign policy, 49% approve of the job Obama is doing; 46% disapprove of his performance. This is essentially the same rating he received last month. [NBC/WSJ 10/20/12]

<br><br>
This brings the Romney+RNC total for the campaign to $802 million. The Obama+DNC total for the campaign is $924 million.
<br><br>
The following compares the two Presidential campaigns and each of their national Party committees through <strong>September 30</strong> of this 2011-12 election cycle. Effectively, Obama has controlled the DNC throughout this period, and Romney has taken control of his national Party mechanism since he became the putative nominee. It also compares the two Super PACs specifically organized to support each of the two candidates. (Other Super PACs, as well as non-disclosing
501(c )(4)s, are playing in this space as well.)
<br><br>
The Romney campaign announced raising $112 million in the first half of October. The Obama campaign raised $90 million. These amounts do not include money raised by the two national political parties during that period.

As the size of the early vote grows from election to election, those who are responsible for crafting the exit polls are increasingly challenged. They are faced with having to bake in the results of this early vote as they gather election day information at polling places around the country.
<br><br>
In 2008, the early exit polls did not correctly predict the direction of the election, and in 2012 those early numbers are likely to be as off as they were four years ago. Actually, the later iterations of the polls were off as well.
<br><br>
So, of course, tap all of your sources looking for early data, but don’t start the celebration too early. Perish the thought we should have to wait until all the votes are actually counted.

Keep in mind that the efficacy of likely voter samples is dependent on the “likely voter” model that each poll uses in determining which respondents to be treated as likely voters.
<br><br>
Gallup’s analysis of likely voter information collected since October 1st suggests a 2012 electorate that looks a lot like 2008. (2008 data is based on the final pre-2008 Gallup survey.)
<br><br>
However, one demographic that appears to be different is self-identification as a Republican, Democrat or Independent.

When identifying “likely voters,” the NBC/WSJ survey looks at three pieces of data. The survey uses a ten-point scale reflecting interest in the election, voting history, and the age of the respondent.
<br><br>
Using only the ten-point scale, on which a score of 10 or 9 is treated as sufficient interest in the election to make a person likely to vote, here is a look at potential voter interest in 2012, 2008 and 2004 at roughly the same time in the election season.
<br><br>
The interest of men and women generally is about where it was in 2008 and relatively close to 2004. However, there are substantial differences in a number of other categories.
<br><br>
Romney voters show roughly the same level of interest as did McCain and Bush voters in the two previous elections. However, the interest of Obama voters in 2012 is running 18 points behind Obama voters in 2008 and 14 points below Kerry voters in 2004.
<br><br>
The interest of those 65 years of age and older is running just about exactly where it was running in 2008 and 2004. However, among 18-34 year olds interest is running 23 points behind 2008 and 14 points behind 2004.
<br><br>
The other substantial disparity is found among Hispanics whose interest is running 20 points behind 2008.

A friend whose judgement WW trusts, puts great faith in the InTrade Prediction Market. His view is that thousands of gamblers have a pretty good handle on what is going on in the country.
<br><br>
As of 10/25/12, the price per share being bid for Obama shares is $6.20, while the bid price for Romney shares is $3.80.

                                 Below is a chart of the 9 States which are described as the battleground states. Obama won them all in 2008. Bush won 7 of them in 2004 and 7 of them in 2000. As opposed to the national match race, the availability of reliable Presidential campaign polling on a State-by-State basis is quite modest. The numbers below are based on the current Real Clear Politics averages which include every “cat and dog” that is published. The following chart should be read with that caveat in mind.
<br><br>
At this time:
<br><br>
Obama leads marginally or better in <strong>five</strong> States <br>
Romney leads in <strong>two</strong> of these States<br>
<strong>Two</strong> States are even
<br><br>
While not specifically reflected in the chart below, Cook Political Report reporting of characterizations by Democratic and Republican pollsters shows Obama with leads in six States, Romney in two, and one is even.
<br><br>
Short of some untoward event, the race in these States appears to provide a firewall for Obama.
<br><br>
Unemployment in 8 of the 9 States is lower than it was one year earlier.

                                 In these final days of the campaign, the two candidates need to accomplish different tasks.
<br><br>
The Romney campaign needs to answer the question that some voters have following his changes of position over the last couple of weeks: “Can I trust the man who he appears to be now or, if elected, will he again become the man he was earlier in the campaign?” And the campaign must continue to remind voters of what Romney describes as the failures of Obama in the last four years.
<br><br>
The Obama campaign must spend a good chunk of its effort convincing folks that the earlier Romney is the real Romney. At the same time, they need to give those undecided voters some idea of how the next four years will be different and better than the last four years if Obama is reelected.

<h2>The Presidential Race</h2>

The debates are over, the race is on its final lap. In 10 days it will be over. A President will be re-elected or a new President will be anointed. At least it is scheduled to be over.
<br><br>
There are four plausible initial outcomes to the election.
<br><br>
President Obama wins the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, and sets about his second term.
<br><br>
Mitt Romney wins the popular vote and the Electoral College vote, and begins work on his transition and inauguration in January 2013.
<br><br>
Romney wins the popular vote, but Obama wins the Electoral College vote. Unless there is an Electoral College blowout, which is not likely, the winner of the election may not be known until December, since that result will likely trigger one or more State-based recounts. (It is unlikely that the reverse would occur, with Obama winning the popular vote and Romney winning in the Electoral College.)
<br><br>
Regardless of who wins the the popular vote, there is at least the possibility of 269 to 269 tie in the Electoral College. Assuming no State-based recounts are successful, the election is then thrown into the House of Representatives, which would undoubtedly select Romney. Thereafter, the Senate selects the Vice President. Even if the Democrats continue to hold the Senate, there are enough Democratic Senators, if not all of them, who would support the Republican nominee. (It is fun to think about the possibility of Joe Biden being elected to a second term.)
<br><br>
Here is how the election has tracked, based on likely voters, since before the respective Party conventions. [Note: Around the early part of October the picture painted of the election by the Gallup survey, based on a seven-day rolling average, began to diverge from the results presented by other major media surveys.]
<br><br>
Leading up to the two conventions the race was about even, ranging from a +1 Romney lead to a +1 Obama lead.
<br><br>
Post-convention and leading up to the first debate on October 3rd, Obama led consistently by +1 to as high as + 8 in mid-September. In the week just before the first debate the Obama lead was +2 to +4.
<br><br>
Following the first debate Romney took a slight lead, ranging from +0 to +4. The clear consensus after the 1st debate was that Romney had won. It was as if Obama had decided not to show up.
<br><br>
The morning after that first debate, one or more of the news commentators that WW respects stated that the result of the debate was that Romney was now <strong>acceptable</strong> as a candidate. All of the work that the Obama campaign had done for months to make Romney appear to be unacceptable was wiped out in ninety minutes.
<br><br>
But the result of the first debate was about more than Obama’s weak performance. Romney was decidedly more comfortable. Some suggested that he always did well in such one-on-one encounters, although during the Republican primary they were multi-person events.
<br><br>
It is quite possible that for the first time in this campaign Mitt Romney was able to be more like who he truly is, rather than someone seeking the approval of the most conservative elements of the Republican Party.
<br><br>
To that point, consider the possibility that throughout the campaign Romney had to go through the following process each time he spoke or, more importantly, answered a question.
<br><br>
A question would be posed and, internally, his first instinct would be to respond to the question based on his natural instincts and history. But, before he said anything, he would stop himself and go through his internal checklist of how he was supposed to respond to the question in order to satisfy the conservatives. Only then would he produce an answer. All of this had to happen in a nano-second, and it likely caused some of the awkwardness that Romney demonstrated in public.
<br><br>
In the first debate, for the first time in this campaign, Romney responded as Romney. It made it appear, of course, that Romney was changing a variety of his positions. In fact, he was, but it did not make any difference. Romney was comfortable and had one of his best public performances.
<br><br>
The saying goes that “debates are not important until they are.” Whoever wins the Presidential election, the impact of the first debate will be part of the 2012 election history.
<br><br>
The Vice-Presidential debate came next, on October 11th. Vice President Joe Biden was declared the winner over Congressman Paul Ryan, but it did not have much impact in the overall race. In the five days between the VP debate and the 2nd Presidential debate five days later, the polls ranged from Romney +4 to Obama +5.
<br><br>
The second Presidential debate took place on October 16th. Obama showed up in body and in spirit, and was pronounced the winner by media commentators.
<br><br>
The first survey taken in its entirety after the debate was the NBC/WSJ survey, which was in the field October 17-20. It found the race even among likely voters, at 47% to 47%. In the previous NBC/WSJ survey, which finished on September 30th, Obama led by 49% to 46%. Perhaps the most dramatic finding of this survey was that Obama led Romney among women by only 8% percentage points, as compared to 16% percentage points in the last survey.
<br><br>
Other findings from that survey (registered voters) include:
<br><br>
* By 46% to 38% respondents think that Obama is better able to lead the country than Romney for the next four years
<br><br>
* By 45% to 41% respondents think that Romney is better prepared than Obama to create jobs and improve the economy
<br><br>
* 62% believe that, if Obama is re-elected, he should make major changes in his second term
<br><br>
* Who is preferred when measured against the following qualities

<br><br>
The Gallup survey which ended on October 22th and includes 5 days after the debate in its rolling seven day average has Romney leading among likely voters 51% to 45%. [At this point the Gallup poll is an outlier among major polls.]
<br><br>
The final Presidential debate took place on October 22nd. It was dedicated to foreign policy, although both men regularly connected foreign policy to domestic policy, knowing that the real voter interest is in the latter. Obama was seen to have “won” the debate, but Romney acquitted himself sufficiently well so as not to undercut the aura of acceptability that he now wears.

<br><br>

<br>

In terms of the apparent influence of the debates on the election, the change was in Romney’s favor. Prior to the first debate Obama was leading Romney by a +3-4 points. Following the 3rd Presidential debate Romney leads by about +3, a swing of 6 points.
