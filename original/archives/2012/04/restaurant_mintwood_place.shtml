Amy and Peter took Debbie and me to Mintwood. We will go again.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant there are two primary sections. To the left is the bar area, which has a long traditional bar and a series of tall bar tables. To the right, separated from the bar area by a partial wall, is the dining room. Overall, the restaurant seats roughly 130 people. The dining area is a combination of various sized tables and banquette seating on the far wall.
<br><br>
The kitchen is straight ahead as you enter and is open, in case you want to spend a bit of time watching food preparation.
<br><br>
The serving personnel were particularly well informed about the various dishes being offered on the then-current menu.
<br><br>
If there is any downside to this restaurant it is that it is quite loud. There is a bit of a din.
The French bread that was offered up was particularly good.
<br><br>
I was also taken by the speed in which the plates were removed after a particular dish was completed.
<br><br>
Amy started with Clams, ramp and spinach soup, followed by a main course of Skate wing, Provencal, socca and caponata.
<br><br>
Debbie began with Burrata, asparagus and Spring garlic, and chose as her main course Wood-grilled soft shell crab, spring Vidalia, quinoa, which is available either an appetizer or a main course.
Peter started with Crab imperial flammekueche, and then for his entrée the Whole boneless dorade, braised fennel, olive picholine olives.
<br><br>
I opened with an Iceberg salad with blue cheese dressing, and then had an excellent Cast-iron chicken.
<br><br>
For dessert, we all shared Rhubarb & strawberry crumble a la mode.
<br><br>
The men’s room has fun, rather old-style, fixtures. The urinal is a white ceramic floor to mid-height model, separated from the rest of the room by a partial wall that goes to shoulder height. The washbasin is a white ceramic trough that is attached to the wall at waist height, and has two silver faucets with a round-necked water tube from which water comes forth. The commode is also white ceramic of similar style to the urinal and washbasin located in the corner. The wastebasket is a wooden cask next to the washbasin, under a corner- connected shelf on two legs.
<br><br>
The walls are white ceramic tiles up to about shoulder height, and the rest of the walls and ceiling are painted in a light, dull yellow-like color. The floor is white ceramic interlaced strips with tiny black intersections.
<br><br>
The opaque glass-centered door is edged with dark wood, as is the door frame.
<br><br>
Valet parking is available at the corner just before the restaurant, when you turn on to Columbia Road.
