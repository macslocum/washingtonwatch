Amy and Peter took Debbie and me to Mintwood. We will go again.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant there are two primary sections. To the left is the bar area, which has a long traditional bar and a series of tall bar tables. To the right, separated from the bar area by a partial wall, is the dining room. Overall, the restaurant seats roughly 130 people. The dining area is a combination of various sized tables and banquette seating on the far wall.
<br><br>
The kitchen is straight ahead as you enter and is open, in case you want to spend a bit of time watching food preparation.
<br><br>
The serving personnel were particularly well informed about the various dishes being offered on the then-current menu.
<br><br>
If there is any downside to this restaurant it is that it is quite loud. There is a bit of a din.
The French bread that was offered up was particularly good.
<br><br>
I was also taken by the speed in which the plates were removed after a particular dish was completed.
<br><br>
Amy started with Clams, ramp and spinach soup, followed by a main course of Skate wing, Provencal, socca and caponata.
<br><br>
Debbie began with Burrata, asparagus and Spring garlic, and chose as her main course Wood-grilled soft shell crab, spring Vidalia, quinoa, which is available either an appetizer or a main course.
Peter started with Crab imperial flammekueche, and then for his entrée the Whole boneless dorade, braised fennel, olive picholine olives.
<br><br>
I opened with an Iceberg salad with blue cheese dressing, and then had an excellent Cast-iron chicken.
<br><br>
For dessert, we all shared Rhubarb & strawberry crumble a la mode.
<br><br>
The men’s room has fun, rather old-style, fixtures. The urinal is a white ceramic floor to mid-height model, separated from the rest of the room by a partial wall that goes to shoulder height. The washbasin is a white ceramic trough that is attached to the wall at waist height, and has two silver faucets with a round-necked water tube from which water comes forth. The commode is also white ceramic of similar style to the urinal and washbasin located in the corner. The wastebasket is a wooden cask next to the washbasin, under a corner- connected shelf on two legs.
<br><br>
The walls are white ceramic tiles up to about shoulder height, and the rest of the walls and ceiling are painted in a light, dull yellow-like color. The floor is white ceramic interlaced strips with tiny black intersections.
<br><br>
The opaque glass-centered door is edged with dark wood, as is the door frame.
<br><br>
Valet parking is available at the corner just before the restaurant, when you turn on to Columbia Road.

<br><br>
The Congress seems to be unable to get anything of significance done. The level of polarization within the two bodies has reached a level that makes them all but irrelevant in solving the country’s problems.
<br><br>
The National Journal regularly rates the voting records of members of Congress. (2/25/12)
<br><br>
“...no Senate Democrat compiled a voting record to the right of any Senate Republican, and no Republican came down on the left of any Senate Democrat.”
<br><br>
In the last 30 years this has happened only once before – 1999.
<br><br>
Only six Republican House Members compiled records that were slightly to the left of the most conservative Democrat.
<br><br>
The following is a chart of the number of House Members and the number of Senators whose voting records fall between the most conservative and most liberal members of their respective bodies.

<h2>The Senate</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Democrats 51</li>
  <li> Republicans 47</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>

Former Governor Angus King’s entry into the Maine Senate race as an Independent makes it likely that the Republicans will lose the seat being vacated by Olympia Snowe. King was a popular governor, and early polling suggests he will be the eventual winner. While he has stated that he will not announce which caucus he will join unless and until he is elected, the working assumption is that he will caucus with the Democrats. In the chart below this race is treated as Leaning Democratic.
<br><br>
While the seat will not switch Parties if he loses, incumbent Republican Senator Orrin Hatch (UT) easily avoided the fate of incumbent Republican Senator Robert Bennett, who lost his seat by failing to pick up sufficient delegate votes at the Republican State convention, recently concluded. Hatch reportedly received 59.4% of the vote, .6% percentage points short of the 60% needed to avoid a primary. There will be a two-person primary on June 26. In early polling Hatch leads by a substantial margin.
<br><br>
A number of smart people believe that control of the Senate will ultimately come down to the races in Nevada, Ohio and Maine. If the Democrats win two of the three they will retain control.
<br><br>
Here is how the 33 Senate elections, made up of 23 Democratic incumbents (including 2 Independents) and 10 Republican incumbents, look to me at this time. (D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP incumbent in office, I=Ind. incumbent in office). Underlining reflects retirement.

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

While Democrats seem to be doing well in fundraising and many of the candidates they have recruited seem strong, a net gain of 5 – 15 seats by the Democrats seems likely. However, the return of the House to Democratic control is beyond the pale.
<br><br>
The question of whether general angst might result in a number of Members, who otherwise seem safe, losing their seats remains open. General public angst is not diminishing.
<br><br>
In general, potential voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress to a Republican-controlled Congress by 46% to 44%. The following are the preferences reflected in the NBC/WSJ survey going back to April 2009.

WW has regularly reprinted the “House Dashboard” published by the Cook Political Report. The data from January 20, 2011 is from the Dashboard. However, the Dashboard is not being published at this time because of the uncertainties caused by re-districting. Therefore, the chart below (other than 1/20/11) reflects the Cook’s current Competitive House Race Chart through April 19, 2012. [As always, thanks to "The Cook Political Report."]

Conversely, those 65 years of age and older constituted 16% of the electorate, and Obama lost them 45% to 53% for McCain.
<br><br>
Currently, 60% of 18-29 year olds are registered to vote. Among those who are registered, 56% say they will definitely vote, and Obama leads by 64% to 35%. Conversely, 92% of those 65 and older are registered; 77% say they are certain to vote; and they currently support Romney over Obama by 52% to 40%. [Gallup]

President Obama took 67% of the Hispanic vote in the 2008 election. Since then the Hispanic population has continued to grow in an increased number of States. In a recent Fox News survey of Latino voters, Obama leads Romney by 69% to 14%. Romney is rated unfavorably by this community by about 2 to 1.

There is much conversation about the role that women will play in the 2012 Presidential election. At the moment, the support of Obama over Romney by women is a very important part of Obama’s lead in those polls which have him ahead in the race.
<br><br>
Women have been “dominant” in the groups that have supported Democratic nominees over the years. The following is a chart of their role in the Democratic vote, courtesy of “Inside Politics with Bill Schneider,” published by Third Way.

Asked what issues will be extremely/very important to them as they consider who to vote for in the Presidential election, potential voters rank healthcare (80%) and unemployment (79%) at the top of their list. Closely following those issues are the budget deficit and national debt (77%) and gas prices (73%). Further down the list we find government policies concerning birth control at 44%. Not surprisingly, women are significantly more interested than in men in policies relating to birth control. [Gallup]

The number saying they do not support the movement is currently at 64%. Of Republicans who are also Tea Party supporters, 56% say that the term “Republican” better describes them, while 37% say “Tea Party supporter” better describes.

                                 The following is an attempt to summarize campaign fundraising and expenditures for selected Presidential campaigns, national Party organizations, and the larger Super PACs. The data does <em>not</em> include State political parties, 501c (4)s, or 527s. Some of the Super PACs will also spend money on other Federal or State races.
<br><br>
Information in this issue of the Watch is based on information from the Center for Responsive Politics, which, frankly, is an easier source of gross fundraising and spending information than Federal Election Commission reports.
<br><br>
All of which is to say that the picture painted is pretty accurate, but not perfect.
<br><br>
The Obama campaign has raised $191 million through the end of March. This is roughly $46 million less than the $237 million the campaign raised through the 1st quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2008 the campaign raised $133 million. This year it raised $52.2 million.
<br><br>
The campaign has spent $89.9 million and has a net $103.8 million on-hand on April 1st.
<br><br>
While they are running behind in their fundraising, the demand timing of the money is different than it was in 2008. There is no primary campaign. All of the campaign’s expenditures are directed to the general election.
<br><br>
In the 2007-08 cycle (through 11/24/08) the Obama campaign raised $778 million and spent $760 million. To reach that amount, the campaign has to raise $586.3 million between now and the 2012 election. This amounts to just under $84 million per month.
<br><br>
None of the above includes the amount that has been raised for the Democratic National Committee, most of the resources of which will be dedicated to the President’s re-election. Recently, the campaign informed the House and Senate leadership that they should not expect to receive any help from the DNC during this cycle. To date, the DNC has raised $175.7 million and has $38.4 million on hand.
<br><br>
The Romney campaign raised $86.6 million through the end of March, and has spent $76.6 million leaving a net $10.1 as April 1st. The Romney campaign spent $11.5 more than the other three Republican candidates in the field at the end of March.
<br><br>
Now the money chase begins in earnest. The Romney campaign has connected up with the Republican National Committee in a joint fundraising effort. Overall, in 2008 the Obama campaign spent just over twice as much during the whole cycle than did John McCain. That will not happen this time around.

While Super PACs will continue to raise and spend money, the real financiers of large parts of the non-Party, non-candidate campaign activity will be non-profit organizations, which do not have to reveal their donors to the public.
<br><br>
There is some evidence that the public will never know the identify of those who donate to groups not affiliated with the candidates or political Parties during the 2012 campaign.
<br><br>
To the extent that this activity involves advertising in various forms of media, there are organizations which regularly monitor this kind of activity and their findings will be disclosed periodically. For example, the April 26th edition of the Washington Post carries a story about this form of advertising/spending. One of the examples used is the Crossroads organization, which includes Crossroads GPS, a 501c(4), and American Crossroads, a Super PAC.
<br><br>
Crossroads GPS, the 501c(4), has spent an estimated $12.6 million on anti- Obama advertising. American Crossroads, the Super PAC, has only spent about $300,000.
<br><br>
Undoubtedly, there will be periodic disclosures of this media spending for the duration of the campaign.
<br><br>
However, should a non-profit decide to play in the campaign by hiring hundreds of grassroots organizers in targeted areas and avoiding so-called “express advocacy” language, those expenditures will never be disclosed.

The contest is over. It effectively ended late on the evening of April 3rd , when Romney won all three of the primaries held that day in Wisconsin (most important because Santorum competed there), Maryland and DC. By then he had finished 1st in 23 states and 2nd in 9. Santorum had finished 1st in 11 states and 2nd in 13 states. Gingrich had won 1st place in 2 states and 2nd in 6. Paul had not won a single state.
<br><br>
Subsequently, on April 24th there were 5 more contests. The chart below includes those contests.

The next series of contests was scheduled for April 24th, five States in the Northeast, including Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania, Santorum’s home State. While the contest was over, the open question was how long Santorum would hang in the race, making it awkward for Romney to really turn to the general election.
<br><br>
The only State in the group in which Santorum had any chance was his home State of Pennsylvania. If he failed to win in Pennsylvania, he would have no basis for continuing the race, except to make Romney’s life miserable, something that is not in Santorum’s long-term interest.
<br><br>
As of early March, Santorum was leading Romney in Pennsylvania by 14 – 18 points. By the end of March, the spread had dropped to 6 points. And, as of the first week of April, a survey that had Santorum up by 18 points in early March now had Romney leading by 5 points.
<br><br>
By April 10th, Romney had accumulated 660 delegates, while Santorum trailed badly with 281 delegates. Gingrich and Paul together had 186 delegates. 144 are needed to nominate. As of April 25th, Romney has 844 delegates. [WP tally]
<br><br>
Santorum, seeing the handwriting on the wall, announced on April 11th that he was suspending his campaign. (Suspending the campaign allows him to continue to raise funds through his campaign committee.)
<br><br>
Santorum made an interesting run. In mid-December 2011 Santorum, when matched in a national survey against Romney, Gingrich and Paul, came in at 3% against Romney’s 30%. [CBS]
<br><br>
In early March, Santorum led Romney 34% to 30%. By April 3rd he trailed Romney by 19 points, 44% to 25%. [CBS/NYT][ABC/WP]
<br><br>
Among the reasons why Santorum failed is that, while Republicans trusted Santorum more than Romney to handle social issues 29% to 27%, they trusted Romney over Santorum to handle the economy, 48% to 12%. [WP/ABC 4/12]
<br><br>
From the first day to the last, Santorum’s basic positions did not change.
<br><br>
Now, for reasons that are not clear, Santorum is playing a bit hard to get. He has yet to endorse Romney, even after Romney won all five primaries on
April 24th. The two men are scheduled to meet on May 4th. Perhaps he has decided to keep the world waiting breathlessly for his decision.

It was inexplicable why Newt Gingrich was staying in the race so long. Then he announced he was staking the future of his campaign on the Delaware primary. It is not clear why, but following Romney’s win there, his folks are putting out the word that he is planning to suspend his campaign on May 1st. It is going to be interesting to see how he handles the substantial debt his campaign has incurred.
<br><br>
Ron Paul will stay in to the end because he can, and because he entered the race to make the case for his libertarian point of view, and he continues to be able to do that. He likely garners more attention this way than he would as an about-to- be-former Member of the House of Representatives.

At one time or another five different candidates led the race nationally.

<h2>The Vice Presidential Pick</h2>

And so begins the “search” for a Vice Presidential nominee to be recommended to the Republican convention delegates by the Presidential nominee. As the vetting process has changed and expanded over the years it has become one of the most intrusive experiences that a person might endure.
<br><br>
These changes are often a function of some issue that came up in a previous election which had not been considered during vetting and then became a distraction during the general election .
<br><br>
The endless speculation by media commentators as to whom Romney might pick is in full bloom. Is it Senator Portman (Ohio) or Senator Rubio (Florida- Hispanic) or Governor Christie (New Jersey)?
<br><br>
Meanwhile the CNN/ORC poll asked Republicans to name their top pick. Here is the list. Leading the queue is Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, named by 26%. She is followed by Rick Santorum at 21%; Marco Rubio and Chris Christie at14% each; Paul Ryan at 8%; Bobby Jindal at 5%; Bob McDonnell at1%; and Rob Portman at <1%.

                                 At least for some, if not many, the ubiquity and ease of email has changed what we would have thought of as the practice of social graces. Before email, when a response or circumstance dictated a response, a visit, a phone call, and/or a handwritten or typed note, would be the order of the day. This is no longer the case. Increasingly, an email replaces other methods of communication. There are some arguments in favor of this new way of communicating in these circumstances. It is easier, less complicated, and, since you can do it right away, you are more likely not to forget. On the other hand, it dumbs-down human interaction.

It’s no surprise that self-described over-use of cell phones , the internet and social media is age-driven. Adults were asked whether they personally spend too much time using particular devices or outlets. Here are the percentages of each age group that say they spend too much time on that device/outlet.

The low point during the Obama administration came in February 2009, when 21% thought things were going well and 79% thought they were going badly.

24% are satisfied with the way things are going in America. This is a slight drop from the satisfaction level in March, but higher than the 11% recorded last summer. Self-reported spending by Americans in March hit $74 per day, up from $63 per day in February. [Gallup]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 8.2% for the month of March. A year ago the rate was 8.9%. The average unemployment for 2011 was 8.9%, for 2010 it was 9.6% and for 2009, 9.3%.
<br><br>
Recalling a bit of history, the unemployment rate started to move up in May 2008, when it jumped from 5% in April to 5.4% in May. The rate increased every month thereafter (exception was August/September when the rate did not change) until it reached 7.3% in December. It continued upward in 2009, reaching 10% in October 2009. By the end of 2010, the rate was 9.4% and by the end of 2011 it had fallen back to 8.5% .
<br><br>
Gallup reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 8.5% for mid- April of this year. This is down from 8.6% in February. It also reported a drop to an unadjusted 18.1 % in the number of people unemployed or who are working part-time, but want full-time employment.
<br><br>
[Note: Gallup reports both a seasonally adjusted and an unadjusted number in its report of unemployment. However, it only reports an unadjusted number of those working part-time, but wanting full-time work. So, when compiling the total of the two, Gallup uses the unadjusted numbers.]

60% of Americans say they have enough money to live comfortably. This is the smallest number of people to take this position in the last decade. A full ten years ago, 75% of Americans said they had enough money.

Conversely the number of people who say they do not have sufficient money to live comfortably has grown from 24% in 2002 to 39% in 2012. [Gallup]

68% of Americans now say they know someone who has lost her or his job in the last six months. This is the highest percentage registered by Gallup in the 20+ years it has asked this question. 77% think this is a bad time to being looking for a job. Last November, 90% of Americans had that view.
<br><br>
But, even given the above, 84% think it is at least “not too likely” that they will lose their current jobs. This includes 42% who say it is “not at all likely.” [Gallup 4/23/12]

<h2>Different Takes On the Same Story</h2>

On Friday, April 13th, two major banks, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Company, put out their first quarter results. The next day two major newspapers reported on those results, with distinctly different “takes” on those reports.
<br><br>
The Wall Street Journal, reported on the results with a first section, front page, far right column, story. The headline and first paragraph follow:
<br><br>
“Bank Earnings Dismay Investors”
<br><br>
“Two of the nation’s largest banks released first-quarter results on Friday that disappointed investors, underlining the industry’s struggles with a sluggish economic recovery and the long hangover from the financial crisis.”
<br><br>
The New York Times put the story on the front page of the B section, far right hand column.
<br><br>
“Solid Results at 2 Banks Bode Well For Industry”
<br><br>
“Revenue is back.
<br><br>
“Hard hit by new regulations and a sluggish economy, banks have
struggled to revive top-line performance since the financial crisis, even as profits improved. But two of the nation’s largest lenders, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, reported strong revenue growth on Friday, a surprise that could bode well for the rest of the industry and the broader economy.”

<h2>It Makes A Difference How You Word the Question</h2>

55% of respondents, when asked about the Federal government’s assistance to the U.S. automakers who were in financial trouble, think the companies should have been left alone to succeed or fail on their own. 36% have the opposite view. The “no help” point of view is expressed by 42% of Democrats, 58% of Independents, and 73% of Republicans. [UT/NJCCpoll 2/2011]
<br><br>
A Gallup survey at roughly the same time found 51% against “financial bailout,” while 44% approved. But if the language used to describe the government assistance is changed, so is the survey result. A Pew survey found 56% thought “government loans” to the car companies were “mostly good,” while 36% thought they were “mostly bad.”
<br><br>
According to 42% of Americans, the “energy situation” is very serious. In mid-2001 the number hit 58%. [Gallup]
