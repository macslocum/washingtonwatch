October 17th is the date when the last pre-general contribution and expenditure period closed. Information about the period October 18 through the end of the election and the aftermath has not yet been filed.
<br><br>
The Obama campaign reported raising $632,177,423 from the outset of its opening. The Romney campaign reported raising $389,088,268 during a similar period.
<br><br>
The following compares the two Presidential campaigns and the national Party committees that they effectively controlled. Obama controlled the DNC throughout the campaign period. Romney took control of his national Party mechanism once he became the putative nominee in the spring. There is also a comparison of the two Super PACs specifically organized to support each of the￼two candidates. (Other Super PACs, as well as non-disclosing 501(c )(4)s, are playing in this space as well.)

The two Super PACs organized to specifically support the two Presidential nominees were:

<br><br>
Communication or coordination between the Super PACs and the candidates they support was not permitted. However given the fact that each of the Super PACs was run by folks loyal to the respective candidates, it is not beyond the pale to combine their revenues with the spending of the candidate and Party committees for the purpose of estimating the financial resource available to each candidate.

As of 11/29/12 there were 1,123 Super PACs registered with the Federal Election Commission, including those specifically mentioned in these pages. As a group they made independent expenditures of approximately $661 million.
<br><br>
Approximately 140 of these Super PACs spent more than $100,000 during this election. More than 900 of the PACs did not make a single expenditure. That being the case, why were these groups organized?

Here are five conservative and five liberal Super PACs that were particularly active in addition to those cited above. Most of their spending was directed at Congressional campaigns.
