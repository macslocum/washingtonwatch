<h2>2014</h2>

Democrats would have to pick up 17 seats in the 2014 election in order to become the majority Party. That is not a huge number, but it is a pretty high hill.
<br><br>
The first hurdle is finding the seats, given the redistricting that took place after the 2010 census.
<br><br>
While history does not have to be determinative, other than in 1998, the Party controlling the White House has lost seats in the mid-term election of a President’s second term in office in every election since 1918.
<br><br>
To pursue this question in greater detail bring up Nate Silver’s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/democrats-unlikely-to-regain-house-in-2014/">FiveThirtyEight article of November 16, 2012</a>.
