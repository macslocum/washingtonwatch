Woodmere, Ohio 44122<br>
216-464-3838<br>
Fax 216-464-1822</div>Corky and Lenny’s is a traditional Jewish style delicatessen. There are 216 items on the menu, ranging from an offering called “Mish Mash” -- Matzo ball, Kreplach, Noodles, and Rice in a large bowl for $7.50 -- to the “Lee D’s Apollo – Out of This World” – Imported ham, Roast Turkey, Swiss Cheese, Coleslaw, Lettuce, Tomato, and Thousand Island Dressing on French Bread served with Coleslaw at $11.25.
<br><br>
I have visited Corky and Lenny’s a couple of times, most recently with Debbie and Libby for breakfast.
<br><br>
Debbie ordered the corned beef hash with poached egg. Libby went for an omelet with bacon on the side. I chose an egg-white omelet with mushrooms and onions. I also ordered turkey sausage on the side.
<br><br>
We had a relatively late breakfast and the size of the portions left little room or interest in having lunch that day. Each principal item on the menu is to one extent or another, oversized. This is not the place to dine if you are counting calories.
<br><br>
There is, of course, a fulsome deli counter where you can order meats, fishes, salads and other items to go. If, while eating, you decide to order something off the menu to take with you, your server will take the order and it will be waiting for you at the checkout counter at the front of the restaurant.
<br><br>
The restaurant is very large, with numerous booths and tables of varying sizes. There was a line of people waiting for a table when we arrived, the entire time we were there, and when we departed.
<br><br>
The restaurant feels rather old and so does the men’s room. It is fully serviceable and reasonably clean, but not special and a little musty. There is one urinal and two commodes that are separated by metal dividers. There is a white ceramic wash basin. There are large grey tiles across the floor and up the walls to waist height. Smaller tiles cover the rest of the walls up to the ceiling.
<br><br>
Parking is not a problem. There is a very large parking lot at the front of the strip mall in which the deli is located.
<br><br>
Corky and Lenny’s is opening a second location in the food court of the new casino, scheduled to open on May 14th, in downtown Cleveland.

<h2>The Senate</h2>

The number of Senate races in the Toss-Up category has moved from 8 in January to 10 in March.
<br><br>
In Florida, the race has moved from Lean Democrat to Toss-Up. Republican Congressman Connie Mack is the leader of the pack in the Republican primary, and over the last few months he has moved up to within a few points of Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, whom he would face in the general election.
<br><br>
Maine Republican incumbent Olympia Snowe’s announcement that she would not seek re-election moves a Safe Republican seat to a Toss-Up. There will likely be a three-way race, with former Governor Angus King running as an Independent. King is the odds-on favorite. King has not announced how he will caucus if elected. However, there is a working assumption that he will caucus with the Democrats.
<br><br>
Texas moves from Leaning Republican to Safe Republican, and Indiana moves from Safe Republican to Leaning Republican.
<br><br>
With the entry of former Nebraska Governor and former U.S. Senator Bob Kerry into the race as the putative Democratic candidate, a number of folks suggest that this is a race that should be moved from Leaning Republican at least to Toss- Up. WW thinks that Jennifer Duffy, Senior Editor of the Cook Political Report, has it right when she suggests that it remains to be seen how this race will develop. It has been a long time since Kerry lived in Nebraska, raised political money, or campaigned.

<strong>The U.S. Senate</strong>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 51</li>
  <li> Republicans 47</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>

Here is how the 33 Senate elections, made up of 23 Democratic incumbents (including 2 Independents) and 10 Republican incumbents, look to me at this time. (D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP incumbent in office, I=Ind. Incumbent in office) Underlining reflects retirement.

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

While the Democrats have a lot going for them in the fall elections and prospects for a pickup of seats by the Democrats is good, a takeover of the House by the Democrats does not seem to be in the cards at the moment.
<br><br>
The big question is whether general angst might impact a series of House incumbents who might otherwise seem to be relatively safe.
<br><br>
In general, potential voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress to a Republican-controlled Congress, by 46% to 41%. When voters are asked whether their current Representative deserves reelection or a new person should be given a chance, they opt for the election of a new person by 48% to 40%. [NBC/WSJ 3/12]
<br><br>
WW has regularly reprinted the “House Dashboard” published by the Cook Political Report. The data from January 20, 2011 is from the Dashboard. However, the Dashboard is not being published at this time because of the uncertainties caused by re-districting. Therefore, the chart below (other than 1/20/11) reflects the Cook’s current Competitive House Race Chart through February 9, 2012 . [As always, thanks to “The Cook Political Report.” ]

Interest in the November 2012 Presidential election is running behind where it was running in 2008 at this time. Currently, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being “very interested,” 73% score their interest at 8, 9 or 10. In 2008, that number was 85%. Strangely, the public’s level of interest has dropped since January. [NBC/WSJ 1/12]

The number of those who describe themselves as supporters of the Tea Party Movement has remained steady over the last year, with 28% expressing that view in January 2011 and January 2012. The number who describe themselves as not supporting the movement has dropped slightly, to 63%. [NBC/WSJ 3/12]

<h2>2012 Presidential General Election</h2>

During the first couple of weeks of March Obama’s position against Romney and Santorum has been relatively static. The exception is the March NBC/WSJ survey, which was finished on March 3rd, which had Obama beating Romney by 6 points and Santorum by 14 points. A week later, Obama led Romney by 3 points in one major survey, and trailed Romney by 2 points in another major survey.

One of the unknowns heading into the 2012 general election is the impact of a number of State laws that have been passed that require particular forms of voter identification including photo IDs. Those opposing these laws argue that they have a disproportionate affect on the poor and the elderly. Those who support the statutes argue that they are designed to combat voter fraud, although there is little proof that voter fraud has been a significant problem.
<br><br>
There are a variety of Federal and State actions pending relating to these laws. Stay tuned.

According to the Pew Center on the States, approximately 24,000,000 active voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are inaccurate. In a recent report the Pew Center noted the following:
<br><br>
* At least 52 million eligible citizens remain unregistered (24% of the eligible population)
<br><br>
* More than 1.8 million deceased folks are listed as active voters
<br><br>
* Roughly 2.7 million people have active registrations in more than one State
<br><br>
* About 12 million records have incorrect addresses as a function of the voter moving or an error in basic information collection.

The Goal: 1,142 Committed Republican Convention Delegates by the time of the Republican National Convention, August 27-30, 2012

<br><br>

<br>

There is a strong argument for the proposition that the Republican nominating process is, in fact, all but over. It is hard to see how any of the other three active candidates can overcome the delegate lead built up by Mitt Romney.
<br><br>
To the extent there is a race, it is a two person race, Romney and Rick Santorum. Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul are simply not in it, even though they are continuing their campaigns. 51% of Republicans say that all four should stay in the race until one person actually clinches the nomination.
<br><br>
Romney has finished in first place 20 times and second 8 times. He is the only candidate who has participated in every primary and caucus. Santorum has finished first 10 times and second 11 times.
<br><br>
Romney has racked up 563 of the 1144 delegate votes required for nomination. Santorum is won 263 delegate votes. Even if one adds all the Gingrich and Paul votes to the Santorum total, Santorum still trails by 115 delegates. (Gallup polling suggests that Gingrich supporters – not necessarily delegates – split about 40/40 between Romney and Santorum.)
<br><br>
Paul expresses no illusions about whether he might be the nominee. Rather, he is using this forum, as he has in the past, to express his point of view about the Federal government and how it should be changed.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Gingrich continues to restate the proposition that he could actually win the nomination. As will become evident in the various elements of the Score Board below, he is one of the few people who continue to harbor this illusion.
<br><br>
It is hard to understand why Gingrich continues to press forward . With the primary/caucus season roughly half over, he is running a poor third in the delegate count. If he is aiming for a prime speaking role at the convention (which few people outside the convention hall will see) he could certainly negotiate that as a condition of his withdrawal.

As might be expected, Republican voters trust Romney the most to handle the economy (35% to 18%) and Santorum to handle social issues (31% to 22%). These same voters marginally select Santorum as best reflecting the core values of the Party, 27% to 25%. However, by 52% to 15%, they think Romney has the best chance to beat Obama. [WP/ABC 3/12]

<br>

The campaigns of the two front runners could not be more different.
<br><br>
Romney and the Super PAC supporting him have spent so many times more money than Santorum and the Super PAC supporting him that it is almost beyond calculation. The moral of the story is that media and inexpensive ways of communicating are so ubiquitous that, if a candidate has an interesting story or point of view, she can get out her message.
<br><br>
Romney has an established national headquarters in Boston and well-structured offices in each State in which he competes. Santorum’s campaign has clearly not invested in real estate, but does have a P.O. Box in Verona, PA.
<br><br>
Romney has delegate slates everywhere. Santorum did not have a slate at all in Virginia (a State where his point of view could be quite attractive), and did not field full slates in Ohio or Illinois. Organizing delegate slates (with the possible exception of Virginia) is not an expensive endeavor. It can, for the most part, be done with organized volunteers.
<br><br>
Romney has had to structure a public point of view and message that he and his advisors deemed necessary for him to be appealing to more conservative Republican primary voters and caucus participants. Santorum knows exactly who he is and what he believes, and has decided to be that person, for better or worse.
<br><br>
Santorum is totally comfortable with the hurley burley of the campaign trail and the interaction with potential voters. That is not Romney’s natural turf.
<br><br>
The delegate math suggests that Romney can achieve the number of delegates necessary to secure the nomination by the conclusion of the Utah primary, the last step on the primary journey. There are any number of individuals or groups that thrive on the delegate math and they seem to be generally in tune with each other.

<h2>Exit Polls</h2>

Exit polls are just that, polls taken of voters as they are leaving their polling places. A consortium of media companies underwrites the cost of exit polls in national elections. The media companies do not reveal the results of the exit polls before voting has ended. They do talk about the composition of the electorate. The first tabulation is shared with the sponsors at 5 p.m., and the results do move around in a limited way, but are not broadcast. Here is how the 5 p.m. exit poll results in Alabama and Mississippi compare with the final results.

<h2>The Money</h2>

The following is an attempt to summarize campaign fundraising and expenditures for selected campaigns, political organizations, and Super PACs.
<br><br>
Information is based on Federal Election Commission reports and various other sources. All of which is to say that the picture painted is pretty accurate, but not perfect.
<br><br>
The data does not include any information about various 501(c)(4) organizations, which can spend roughly fifty percent of their assets on campaign related advertising. They are not required to disclose under campaign finance laws and there is no effective analysis of whether they are spending more than 50% on campaign-related communications.
<br><br>
The Obama campaign continues to operate at a level that draws into question whether it can raise and spend as much money in 2012 as it did in 2008. Given that it has raised about $163 million so far this cycle, it must raise $587 million over the seven month period, March – September 30, in order to reach the $750 million raised in 2008. This amounts to roughly $84 million dollars a month. (The September 30 date is selected because most campaign-related activity must be paid for in advance. If one assumes that the campaign will have one additional month to raise its funds then the necessary total per month is just over $73 million per month.)

There is no doubt that SuperPACs will play a huge role in the 2012 elections, both Presidential and congressional. Interestingly, 56% of conservative Republicans think that SuperPACs should be illegal. This view is held by 69% of Americans generally, 80% of Democrats, and 62% of moderate to conservative Democrats. [WP/ABC 3/12]
<br><br>
There is a new SuperPAC. The “Campaign for Primary Accountability” was created for the sole purpose of trying to achieve the loss in the primaries of various incumbents in both Parties. The PAC is apparently not interested in shifting power between Democrats and Republicans. Rather, it is interested in “shifting power between Congress and the people.” The group seems to plan to focus on long time incumbents.

There are at least three issues, in addition to jobs and the economy, which plague the President’s re-election efforts: gasoline prices, birth control, and the new healthcare law.
<br><br>
55% say the government has at least quite a bit of control over gas prices. [NBC/WSJ 3/12]. 54% believe the President can do a lot about the price of gasoline. [CBS/NYT 3/12] It is worth noting that Frank Newport of Gallup and Susan Page of USA Today say that, so far, gas prices are not hurting Obama’s job approval rating.
<br><br>
In the most recent WP/ABC survey [3/12], while 50% believe that the President can do something about gas prices, as noted above, 65% disapprove of the job he is doing to reduce prices.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an unemployment rate of 8.3% in the month of February. That is no change from January. Looking back at the rate for this period of time over the last several years you find the following: February 2011 – 9.0%; February 2010 – 9.8%; February 2009 – 8.3%; February 2008 – 4.9%.
<br><br>
Gallup reported an 8.8% unemployment rate for mid- March. This is up from 8.6% in January, and 8.5% in December 2011, but down from 9.1% in February. It also reported a drop to 18.6 % in the number of people unemployed or who are working part-time, but want full-time employment.
