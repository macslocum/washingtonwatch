This is the largest number of seats to move from one Party to the other since the Democrats picked up 75 seats in 1948.	Notably, the Republicans had picked up 55 seats in 1946.

</ul>

Using "The Cook Political Report’s" Partisan Voting Index (PVI) as the comparison device, 50 of the seats lost by the Democrats had a Republican PVI; 2 were rated as even; and 11 were rated Democratic.	The 3 Republican-held seats that flipped had a Democratic PVI.
