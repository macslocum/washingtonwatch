20.1% of children under the age of 18 in the United States were living in poverty in 2009 (14,807,000).	That percentage grew from 18.5% of children who were so afflicted in 2008.
<br><br>
Even more troubling is the fact that in 2009, 24% of children 4 years of age and younger (5,056,000) were living in poverty.	This is an increase from the 21.8% (4,457,000) who shared that fate in 2008.
<br><br>
The overall poverty rate in this country rose from 13.2% in 2008 to 14.3% in 2009.	The total number of people in poverty grew from 39,800,000 in 2008 to 43,600,000 in 2009.
<br><br>
How is it possible that a country that can spend a billion dollars building a sports stadium and a trillion dollars fighting two wars will allow babies and children to go hungry?
<br><br>
<strong>WW has to wonder what would happen if half of the energy that is being spent on preserving tax breaks for the wealthy were devoted to addressing this extraordinary problem.</strong> 	[Source U.S. Census Bureau]

Unemployment was at 9.6% in August ,with little prospect of any improvement between now and the election.	When those who are unemployed are added to those who are underemployed, the number grows to 18.6%.	[BLS;Gallup]
<br><br>
The country is in a recession, according to 82% of Americans, no change since 2009 when it was 84%. While 52% thought the economy was getting better a year ago, 61% now say that it is getting worse.	[Gallup 9/10]

When asked to volunteer what they believe is the most pressing problem facing the country, 32% of Americans say the “economy”.	Another 28% separately say “jobs”.	The next highest issues, at 3% each, are healthcare and the budget deficit.	In June, 20% named the economy, 13% the gulf oil spill, and 5% cited health care.	[NYT/CBS 9/10]

38% believed the economy is in better shape now than it was 18 months ago. [AP/GfK 8/10]

Then in September -
<br><br>
81% rate the economy as bad and 30% think it is getting worse. [NYT/CBS 9/10]
<br><br>
92% describe the nation’s economy as poor (53%) or not so good (40%). 38% think it is getting worse.	[WP/ABC 9/10]

72% of Americans rely on network news, cable TV, newspapers, magazines, and radio as their primary source of political news and information.	Only 14% rely on online blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and online political sites.	[NBC/WSJ 8/10]
<br><br>
However, confidence in newspapers and TV news are at a 30 year low.	Only 25% have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in newspapers, and an even lesser number, 22%, show the same level of confidence in TV news.	[Gallup 8/10]

The number of internet users, ages 50 and older, who engage in social networking, has grown from 22% to 42% in the last year.	47% of those 50-64 and 26% of those 65 and older now spend time on social network sites.	This compares to 86% of those 18-29 who use these sites.	Among those 30-49, 61% say they are engaged in social networking.
<br><br>
Twitter and similar services are growing, but have not come close to the massive use of Facebook and the like.	11% of those 50-64 use these tools.	At that, it is still twice what it was a year ago.
<br><br>
Even with the adoption of these new tools, email is still the most popular with those over the age of 50.	92% of those 50-64 and 89% of the 65 and older crowd send or read email.	76% of the 50-64 year olds get news online, 42% of them on any given day.	62% of the over 65 group get news online; about a third of them do so on any given day.

In January 2010, 28% were positive about the Tea Party Movement, while 21% were negative.	31% had no opinion.	Now, only 13% do not have an opinion; 30% have a positive opinion, while 34% have a negative opinion.	This suggests that getting to know the Movement is not to come to love it.	[NBC/WSJ 8/10]

<br>
<br>
There are other surveys that suggest there has been little change in attitudes about the Tea Party.	The number who consider it favorably (31%), the number who agree with its positions (34%), and the number who consider themselves to be supporters (28%) have not really changed in the last 4 months.	[AP/GfK 8/10]

<br>
<br>
However, there is no way of denying that the Tea Party is having an impact on the electoral process that was not anticipated at the beginning of this year.

<br>
<br>
There are a lot assumptions being made about whether they will have a significant impact in November.	There are a good many folks that continue to give the Movement the back of its hand.	That may be a mistake.

<br>
<br>
Whether or not you agree with the movement’s point of view, no one can really predict the degree to which it will influence the election this fall.
