                                 Since I ate my first bagel, slicing it in half has been a pretty routine act.	I slice it laterally through the middle and do my best to avoid slicing the hand that is holding the bagel.	Recently I acquired a bagel slicing device.	It is danger-free.
<br><br>
Now I have learned that I have been cutting my bagel the wrong way. Instead of cutting it with a knife, the “better” way is to cut it through by plunging a fork laterally, repeatedly through the bagel until it has been split as if sliced in the more traditional way.	(A 4-tine fork works better than a 3-tine fork.)
<br><br>
So what is the advantage?	After you toast it, instead of a flat surface on which to put warm butter, cream cheese or peanut butter, the spread soaks into the bagel along hundreds of little peaks.
<br><br>
Try it.

Dinner at Siroc was Florence’s idea.	She had become something approaching a regular.	Peter came along to chaperone.	It was a great choice.
<br><br>
The restaurant is bright and cheery (quite a change from the previous restaurant in that location) and has been open from something over a year.
<br><br>
There is inside seating for 63 people at tables of 2, 3, 4 and 5.	Another 30 seats are available outside when the weather permits.	While the tables are not all that far apart, the acoustics of the restaurant are such that the diners at each table can have a private conservation, even though it is a bit noisy.
<br><br>
It was restaurant week and there were two menu’s available, a fixed price menu and the regular menu.	Florence and Peter opted for the restaurant week menu and I selected from the regular menu.
<br><br>
Florence started with the Maryland Crab Cake served with Sautéed Local White Corn, Baby Clams and Heirloom Tomatoes with a Caper Aioli.	For her entrée she chose the Filet of Sea Bream on a Zucchini Puree with Local Red Fingerling Potatoes, Yellow Oyster Mushrooms and a Caviar Sauce.	For dessert Florence went with Crepe filled with Milk Chocolate Mousse and crushed Pistachios severed with a Blackberry Sauce.
<br><br>
Peter opted for the Caesar Salad of Baby Romaine and Treviso Radicchio served with Roasted Shrimp, White Anchovies and Roasted Garlic Focaccia Croutons.	His main course was Lamb Shank Braised with local Tomatoes and Red Onions, served with Cannellini Beans and Patty Pan Squash.	Peter gave me a piece of his lamb; it was melt-in-the-mouth.	He topped off his meal with the Crepe, as well.
<br><br>
I started with a Composed Tower of Avocado, Mango and Roasted Shrimp with Basil Oil and Smoked Prosciutto.	It was a terrific combination of tastes. Next I selected the Roasted Whole Branzino served with Sautéed Spicy Spinach and Red Potatoes Roasted with Lemon Zest.	It was filleted, but the skin is left on and it is served at what was the whole fish without the bone.	It too was cooked perfectly. For dessert I had a Bosc Pear poached in Red Wine with Ginger.	It is usually served with Mascarpone Gelato.
<br><br>
Our server was Claire.	She was friendly, helpful and attentive.	A college student.	Chef/co-owner Martin Lackovic recognized Florence as having been there several times before, and stopped at our table for a chat.	He noted that he is opening a second restaurant later this year at 21st and P, across from the Palomar Hotel and the Starbucks where I sometimes stop on my way to work.
<br><br>
The men’s room has two separate rooms.	The anteroom has a white ceramic washbasin with an appropriate mirror.	The floor is covered with large tan tiles and the walls with a slightly darker fabric wallpaper.	The commode is in a separate room, with a full wooden wall and locking door.	It has the same floor tiles, but the walls are painted a related tan color.	It is quite fresh.
<br><br>
Siroc’s web page says that it “happily will seat walk-ins at any time;” however, it has become quite popular, and I would highly recommend making a reservation to sure of getting in.

We decided to have breakfast at the Vanilla Bean because it opened at 7:00 a.m. and was a 10 minute ride from the resort at which we were staying.	When we arrived at 7:30 a.m. there were 3 other people in the dining room.	By 8:00 a.m. every chair was filled, with people ranging in age from pre-teen to their 70s.
<br><br>
Debbie started with a cup of excellent vanilla bean coffee, while I enjoyed a perfectly done hot chocolate.
<br><br>
The cafe is famous for its oven-baked omelets.	The omelets are round, baked in metal pans, and are about 8 inches across and about an inch high.	I have never seen nor eaten anything like it except, perhaps, for a deep dish pizza.	Of the hundreds (thousands?) of omelets I have eaten nothing comes close.
<br><br>
Debbie ordered the White Pine omelet, with a side of well-done bacon and toast.	The stuffings included mushrooms, artichokes, mozzarella, provolone, Asiago and Parmesan cheeses.
<br><br>
I opted for the Thunder Bay omelet, with a side of well-done bacon.	The stuffings included ham, cheddar-jack cheese and mushrooms.

<br><br>
There is a firm "crust" around the circumference.
<br><br>
One option that grabbed my attention before I chose the omelet was the Scandinavian Breakfast: golden grilled slices of caramel pecan bread-pudding dazzled with burnt sugar caramel sauce.	It comes with ham, bacon or sausage.
<br><br>
If you end up going for lunch rather than breakfast, there is a wide range of sandwiches.	The one that I would order first is the Cranberry Club: smoked turkey, sliced ham, bacon, cucumber, tomato, field greens, with cran-mayo on toasted cranberry bread.
<br><br>
Dinner is also served.
<br><br>
There are 37 seats in the dining room: 6 booths on two walls of the restaurant that seat 24.	There are 3 tables in the middle of the room that will seat up to 12, and a table that seats only one person.

<br><br>
There is a private dining room that seats up to 28 people.
<br><br>
The restroom is pretty "plain vanilla."	There is a white ceramic commode and an accompanying washbasin with a mirror over it.	The walls are painted a dull yellow and the floor is covered with large grey tiles.	There is a sign above the washbasin that states "Please be careful hot water is very hot."	The room is clean, but there is a slight musty odor.
<br><br>
By the way, there is a sign on the wall of the dining room that says "Save your fork."

There are two other treats within a block of the Vanilla Bean.	Literally attached to the Vanilla Bean is a Bridgeman's ice cream store.	Growing up in Duluth, Bridgemans was the most popular ice cream parlor.	There were two of them.
<br><br>
All of the ice creams are excellent, but there is a particular sundae, called the Lala Palooza, that is very good.	It was so large that it was usually shared by two or more people.	If you finished it on your own, you were given a certificate suitable for framing.	On one occasion, I ate two Lala Palooza's in one sitting.	It was a store record for a long time.
<br><br>
The other treat, just a block away, was a Dairy Queen.	There is nothing like a large Dairy Queen in a cup covered with hot fudge.
<br><br>

<strong>How to Get There From D.C.</strong>
<br><br>
By Plane: Delta Airlines from D.C. to Minneapolis, transfer to Delta connection for trip to Duluth.	Rent car and drive one hour.	If you take the 6:47 a.m. plane from National Airport, you can get to the Vanilla bean in time for a 12:30 p.m. lunch.
<br><br>
By Automobile: Drive 1195 miles, 20 hours

<em>Note:</em> I was asked the other day why I never suggest that a restaurant is not very good.	As I think I noted many years ago, I only write about restaurants that I enjoyed either for the cuisine or accommodation.

<br>

Susie, Jimmy, Debbie, and I came here for dinner after an evening of theater – “Bloody Andrew Jackson.”
<br><br>
As you enter, there is a small area to the left where you can sit to have a drink, probably a waiting area for those whose tables are not yet available.	There is a bar to the right.
<br><br>
The main dining area seats about 50 people.	There is a banquet that runs along the front wall of the dining area; it continues along the long side wall of the restaurant, and then continues along a part of the back wall of the dining area. There are a series of two-person tables that can be put together for larger parties. We had a great table in the far back corner of the dining area, which allowed us to sit on 3 sides of a table.
<br><br>
On the other long wall of the dining area is a community table with 5 chairs on each side.	The walls are dark and dimly lit.	The floors are of wood.	There is a private dining room behind near the end of the bar.
<br><br>
One of the interesting options of the restaurant is to allow its patrons to order half portions of two entrees.
<br><br>
Susie started with a Salad of Local Green Asparagus and Mizuna with a Pickled Ramp Vinaigrette, Ricotta Dressed with Tarragon and Pink Pepperworms. She then had a half-portion of Ravioli of Goat Cheese, Parsley and Lemon Zest, Roasted Baby Beets and Sugar Snap Peas with a Roasted Garlic Foam, and a half order of Roasted Wild Striped Bass, Ramps Sautéed with Smoked Shiitake, Carrot- Coriander Puree and Fiddlehead Ferns.	For dessert she selected Wild Huckleberry-Hazelnut Tart, Huckleberry Ice Cream and Honey Crème Fraiche.
<br><br>
Debbie started with a half-portion of the Ravioli. and then a similar portion of the Pacific Halibut Crushed with Sea Scallops in a Saffron-Cockle Broth, Braised Spring Onions, Fava Beans and a Spring Onion Fondue.	She also savored the Huckleberry Tart.
<br><br>
Wild Nettle Soup with a Parmesan Foam and a Stew of Hen of the Woods Mushrooms was the appetizer choice of Jim.	He followed that with Roasted Long Island Duck Breast with Mustard Greens and Farro Baby Turnips Glazed with Olives and Rosemary, Turnip Green Puree and a half portion of the Bass.	His dessert – a Hazelnut-Milk Chocolate Mousse over Cocoa Streusel, Salted Caramel Ice Cream & Chocolate Ganache.
<br><br>
I started with Duck Rillette with Moutarde Violette and Toasted Brioche, Rhubarb Compote, Field Mache and Dick Crackling Salad.	Then, breaking with my usual practice of avoiding beef, I picked Braised Beef Short Ribs and Escargot Glazed and Orange and Parsley, Wild nettle Risotto and Baby Carrots.	I was glad I made the exception.	They were perfect.	The restaurant was not comfortable with the idea that I would only have one entrée, while each of the others were having two, so they brought me a tasting of another entrée, but I do not recall what it was.	I finished with Poached Rhubarb over White Chocolate Ganache, Rhubarb Sorbet with a Pistachio Sablee.
<br><br>
The service was very good.	I was particularly taken with the fact that our serving person was not comfortable with me having one less course than my companions.
<br><br>
The menu changes daily, and although I do not know what time each day’s menu is posted online, it is likely that you can take a look at the menu before you decide whether you want to eat at the restaurant that day.
<br><br>
The men’s room is tiny.	It reminded me of <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2007/05/restaurant_quince.shtml">Quince</a>, in its old location in San Francisco.	It is very dim.	There is a white ceramic commode and a very small white ceramic washbasin.	Next to the washbasin is a small stand and over it a mirror. There is a pile of towels.	The walls are dark blue.

                                 The die is cast and, with a few exceptions, many, if not most, competitive races in the Senate and House are decided.	There is a flood, and it seems to be rolling over the Democrats.	Only if there is a sudden increase in interest in the election by Democratic voters will the anticipated outcome be modified.
<br><br>
It is not that the Republicans are so popular.	In fact, the Republican Party is less popular than the Democratic Party.	In the August NBC/WSJ survey the Democratic Party is rated positively by 33% of respondents, while 44% rate it negatively.	The Republican Party is in worse shape, 24% rate it positively and 46% negatively.
<br><br>
In the most recent Gallup report on Party identification, more Americans identify themselves as being Democrats or leaning Democrat, by 44% to 41%, than as Republicans.	This is a slight improvement from Gallup’s August survey, which found equal numbers (42%) identifying with each of the Parties.
<br><br>
However, even this latest finding represents a significant drop in the number claiming a Democratic Party affiliation, as well as the spread between the two Parties.	The following are the poll’s findings over the last 21 months.

Democrats are more trusted than Republicans to do a “better job of coping with the problems the nation faces over the next few years,” by 40% to 37%.
<br><br>
By 45%-42% Americans think Democrats most represent their values, and by 48%-39% they think Democrats are more concerned with the needs of people like themselves. [WP/ABC 9/10]
<br><br>
Americans trust the Democrat Party more than the Republican party to handle the economy and health care by small margins.	They trust the Republican Party over the Democrat Party to handle immigration, Afghanistan, the budget deficit, and taxes by similar margins.	[WP/ABC 9/10]
<br><br>
However, the Democrats are the Party in power, and its Congressional members are being held accountable for the fact that life is not going well for so many people.
<br><br>
Only 33% of registered voters say their Member of Congress should be re-elected.	59% say that most Republicans in Congress should not be re-elected, while 58% say the same thing about most Democrats in Congress.
<br><br>
Disapproval of the job being done by the Congress is one subject on which most polls seem to agree.	The Real Clear Politics average for August was 73% disapprove – 22% Approve.
<br><br>
Additionally, if you are unhappy with President Obama, one of the ways in which you can specifically express your feelings is by voting against Democrat candidates for Congress.
<br><br>
When they hear about the major accomplishments of the administration and the Congress they do not see how these actions will make their lives better now.	In fact they think some of those “accomplishments” are antithetical to what they see as their best interests.
<br><br>
The 2008 election was set up as a “choice” election.	Democrats were chosen to continue control of the Congress and to take control of the White House.	Voters seem to be coming to the conclusion that they made the wrong choices in 2008, and they are planning to try and rectify their “mistake” in 2010.
<br><br>
There is no doubt that the Democrats will lose seats in the Senate and the House in November; the question is how many?
<br><br>
Those who follow the races most thoroughly (not including the various Party political committees) seem confident that the Democrats will retain control of the Senate, with a narrow 52-53 seat margin, including the two independents.
<br><br>
There are predictions about the future control of the House available around every corner.	Some of opinions are worth more than others.	But among those who have some credibility, the number of likely Democrat losses ranges from 37 to 60. The two public prognosticators with whom WW is most comfortable are Charlie Cook, who is now predicting a 40 seat Democratic loss, and Stu Rothenberg, who is suggesting a 37-42 seat Republican pickup.

With Labor Day behind us, it is hard to see what might happen that would boost the fate of endangered Democrat incumbents.
<br><br>
The primary season has not been kind to incumbents.	7 of them have lost primary contests.	Among the 4 Republicans are two Senators (Bennett –UT, Murkowski -Alaska) and 2 House members (Griffith –AL 5th and Inglis – SC 4th). The 3 Democrats include 1 Senator (Specter – PA) and 2 House members (Kilpatrick – MI 13th and Mollohan – WV 1st).

<h2>U.S. Senate</h2>

The Senate landscape continues to change.	The number of Safe Democrat seats has dropped from 8 to 7, while the number of Safe GOP seats has jumped from 13 to 14.	There continue to be 12 seats rated as Toss Ups.

Since the first issue of WW in this cycle, <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/2010_congressional_campaigns.shtml">April 2009</a>, the number of Senate seats that are Solid or Leaning Democrat has dropped from 15 to 8.	The number of Solid or Leaning Republican seats has grown from 15 to 18 and back to 17.	The number of Toss-up seats has grown from 7 to 12.

Following her victory in Delaware, most everyone on both sides of the political aisle have written off Christine O’Donnell’s prospects in the general election.	There is much to speak for that position.	O’Donnell has said some pretty “interesting” things in her past life, and there are hints that she is not the most responsible person in her personal life.
<br><br>
However, this is not an ordinary year, and if it looks to the voters of Delaware that she is being picked on unnecessarily, and if she spends her time talking about the things they care about.....just about anything might be possible.
<br><br>
Here is something to ponder.	If Charlie Crist (running as an Independent) wins the Senate race in Florida, with whom will he caucus?	In the short run, it would seem logical that he would caucus with the Democrats.	He is disappointed with the Republicans in Florida, and it is generally better to be part of the majority than the minority.
<br><br>
On the other hand, if after he is elected, he looks beyond the current Senate, to the 2012 Senate elections he may decide he is better off caucusing with the Republicans from the outset.	In 2012, 23 Democrat incumbents are on the ballot, as opposed to 9 Republicans.	If he decides to go with the Democrats, he might find himself in the minority two years later.

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>

There is no question that the Democrats will lose a large number of House seats in the coming election.	Theoretically, a 39-seat shift will give the Republicans control.	However, there is general agreement that the Republicans will probably lose 3 or 4of the seats they currently hold.	If that occurs, the magic number is 42 or 43.
<br><br>
The generic ballot question is considered to be significant when it comes to predicting House elections, but not Senate elections.
<br><br>
The poll that surveys most often on this question is Gallup.	For the week of August 23-29 it showed the Republicans winning by 10 points, 51% - 41%.	This was the highest spread that Gallup had found for either Party in its history.
<br><br>
In its survey conducted from August 30-September 5, Gallup found an even 46%-46% split on its generic ballot.	It has to make you wonder whether something wasn’t a little wacky with one or the other of these surveys.	But fear not, in its most recent survey conducted September 6-12, Gallup reported a 5-point Republican advantage, 48%-43%.	That makes everything perfectly clear.
<br><br>
There are often differences in result if the question is asked of likely voters rather than registered voters.	Especially in a mid-term election, the number and nature of the voters who will actually come out on election day is dramatically different.	An example of this difference shows up in the last WP/ABC survey (8/30-9/2).	Registered voters said they would vote Republican by 47%-45%. Likely voters went Republican 53% to 40%.
<br><br>
A second example is the September 10-14 NYT/CBS survey.	Among all adults the Democrats are up +4 percentage points.	Among likely voters, the Republicans are up +2 percentage points.
<br><br>
In the surveys noted below the question is asked of <strong>registered</strong> voters, unless otherwise noted.
<br><br>
Set out below are results from a series of surveys conducted since early summer.

The NBC/WSJ survey puts the question slightly differently than most of the others: it asks respondents for their preference for the outcome of the coming Congressional elections.	Therefore, its results for this summer are listed separately. So far this year, it is questioning registered vs. likely voters.

For at least the last 30 years the incumbent President’s Party has not gained seats in a mid-term election.
<br><br>
One of the indicators of how many seats a President’s Party will lose is the President’s approval rating leading up to the election in the Gallup survey.	Other apparent indicators, at least since 1994, are the Wrong Track number in the NBC/WSJ survey (ex: are things in the country on the wrong track) and the disapproval of Congress number in the ABC/WP survey.
<br><br>
Here is what the numbers looked like in late August and early September of the election years listed below.

                                 If one steps back and thinks about what has been accomplished during the first 21 months of the Obama administration, the list is quite impressive:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Healthcare Reform</li>
<li> Increased regulation of banks and financial institutions </li>
<li> The largest economic stimulus package in history </li>
<li> Rescue of 2 major U.S. auto manufacturers </li>
<li> Setting a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq </li>
<li> And sticking to it </li>
<li> Lifting restrictions on stem cell research </li>
<li> Expanding children’s health insurance </li>
<li> Appointed the first Latina and the 4th woman to the Supreme Court</li>
</ul>

The list actually goes on and on. The irony is that most of the major accomplishments are not popular with the public.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Increasing regulation of financial institutions receives 61% approval</li>
<li> 52% disapprove the economic stimulus package</li>
<li> 56% disapprove salvaging the auto makers </li>
<li> 61% disapprove the rescue of banks and other financial Institutions</li>
</ul>

The initiative that took the most time and effort, reform of the healthcare system, is disapproved by 56%.	[Gallup 9/10]

40% think the country is worse off since Obama became President, as opposed to 31% who say the country is better off.
<br><br>
32% strongly relate to him while 27% do not relate to him. 40% are confident that the President has the right goals and
<br><br>
Policies, while 38% are not at all confident. 65% say he has “fallen short” of changing business as usual
<br><br>
in Washington. 67% say he has “fallen short” as relates to the budget deficit. 60% say he has “fallen short” on the economy. 29% find the President too anti-business, while 14% think he is too pro-business.

To this day, Obama is essentially not being blamed for the current economy. In fact, his administration ranks a poor fifth on a list of those who might be blamed. 37% still blame the Bush administration, while 21% blame Wall Street and financial institutions.	Congress shows up next, at 11%, and 8% select “someone else”.	The Obama administration comes in at 5%.	[NYT/CBS 9/10]
<br><br>
The President’s approval rating has been below 50% since the middle of the year.

There is no doubt that the President is an extraordinary speaker. move an audience, especially an audience that is in the room with him. President rarely speaks directly to his largest audience, the American public at large, those people who are never in the room, the people (like WW) that only see and hear him through the magic of TV or the internet.
<br><br>
Because the President relies on tele-prompters on almost every public occasion, he constantly looks to his left and to his right.	Rarely does he look straight ahead.	The only time he has looked “me” in the eye is on his weekly Saturday video commentary from the Oval Office and his two primetime Oval Office addresses.	The reason he looks me in the eye on those occasions is because the tele-prompter is straight ahead, under the lens of the TV camera.
<br><br>
Look me in the eye Mr. President.

The number of internet users, ages 50 and older, who engage in social networking, has grown from 22% to 42% in the last year.	47% of those 50-64 and 26% of those 65 and older now spend time on social network sites.	This compares to 86% of those 18-29 who use these sites.	Among those 30-49, 61% say they are engaged in social networking.

Twitter and similar services are growing, but have not come close to the massive use of Facebook and the like.	11% of those 50-64 use these tools.	At that, it is still twice what it was a year ago.

Even with the adoption of these new tools, email is still the most popular with those over the age of 50.	92% of those 50-64 and 89% of the 65 and older crowd send or read email.	76% of the 50-64 year olds get news online, 42% of them on any given day.	62% of the over 65 group get news online; about a third of them do so on any given day.

In January 2010, 28% were positive about the Tea Party Movement, while 21% were negative.	31% had no opinion.	Now, only 13% do not have an opinion; 30% have a positive opinion, while 34% have a negative opinion.	This suggests that getting to know the Movement is not to come to love it.	[NBC/WSJ 8/10]

<br>
<br>
There are other surveys that suggest there has been little change in attitudes about the Tea Party.	The number who consider it favorably (31%), the number who agree with its positions (34%), and the number who consider themselves to be supporters (28%) have not really changed in the last 4 months.

However, there is no way of denying that the Tea Party is having an impact on the electoral process that was not anticipated at the beginning of this year.

<br>
<br>
There are a lot assumptions being made about whether they will have a significant impact in November.	There are a good many folks that continue to give the Movement the back of its hand.	That may be a mistake.
