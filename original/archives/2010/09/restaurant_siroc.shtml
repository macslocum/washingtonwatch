Dinner at Siroc was Florence’s idea.	She had become something approaching a regular.	Peter came along to chaperone.	It was a great choice.
<br><br>
The restaurant is bright and cheery (quite a change from the previous restaurant in that location) and has been open from something over a year.
<br><br>
There is inside seating for 63 people at tables of 2, 3, 4 and 5.	Another 30 seats are available outside when the weather permits.	While the tables are not all that far apart, the acoustics of the restaurant are such that the diners at each table can have a private conservation, even though it is a bit noisy.
<br><br>
It was restaurant week and there were two menu’s available, a fixed price menu and the regular menu.	Florence and Peter opted for the restaurant week menu and I selected from the regular menu.
<br><br>
Florence started with the Maryland Crab Cake served with Sautéed Local White Corn, Baby Clams and Heirloom Tomatoes with a Caper Aioli.	For her entrée she chose the Filet of Sea Bream on a Zucchini Puree with Local Red Fingerling Potatoes, Yellow Oyster Mushrooms and a Caviar Sauce.	For dessert Florence went with Crepe filled with Milk Chocolate Mousse and crushed Pistachios severed with a Blackberry Sauce.
<br><br>
Peter opted for the Caesar Salad of Baby Romaine and Treviso Radicchio served with Roasted Shrimp, White Anchovies and Roasted Garlic Focaccia Croutons.	His main course was Lamb Shank Braised with local Tomatoes and Red Onions, served with Cannellini Beans and Patty Pan Squash.	Peter gave me a piece of his lamb; it was melt-in-the-mouth.	He topped off his meal with the Crepe, as well.
<br><br>
I started with a Composed Tower of Avocado, Mango and Roasted Shrimp with Basil Oil and Smoked Prosciutto.	It was a terrific combination of tastes. Next I selected the Roasted Whole Branzino served with Sautéed Spicy Spinach and Red Potatoes Roasted with Lemon Zest.	It was filleted, but the skin is left on and it is served at what was the whole fish without the bone.	It too was cooked perfectly. For dessert I had a Bosc Pear poached in Red Wine with Ginger.	It is usually served with Mascarpone Gelato.
<br><br>
Our server was Claire.	She was friendly, helpful and attentive.	A college student.	Chef/co-owner Martin Lackovic recognized Florence as having been there several times before, and stopped at our table for a chat.	He noted that he is opening a second restaurant later this year at 21st and P, across from the Palomar Hotel and the Starbucks where I sometimes stop on my way to work.
<br><br>
The men’s room has two separate rooms.	The anteroom has a white ceramic washbasin with an appropriate mirror.	The floor is covered with large tan tiles and the walls with a slightly darker fabric wallpaper.	The commode is in a separate room, with a full wooden wall and locking door.	It has the same floor tiles, but the walls are painted a related tan color.	It is quite fresh.
<br><br>
Siroc’s web page says that it “happily will seat walk-ins at any time;” however, it has become quite popular, and I would highly recommend making a reservation to sure of getting in.
