<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/05/restaurant_the_buckeye_roadhou.shtml">Restaurant: The Buckeye Roadhouse</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> This is clearly a neighborhood restaurant. Dress is primarily casual to very casual, and the diners include young children and babies.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/05/restaurant_prospect.shtml">Restaurant: Prospect</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> As a gesture to environmental consciousness, the menu for the evening we were there was printed on the back side of the menu from the night before.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/05/restaurant_sauce.shtml">Restaurant: sauce</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> As a gesture to environmental consciousness, the menu for the evening we were there was printed on the back side of the menu from the night before.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/05/restaurant_serpentine.shtml">Restaurant: Serpentine</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> The restaurant is located in an old industrial section of town which is going through a kind of rebirth. The inside of the restaurant can also best be described as industrial.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/03/restaurant_quince_1.shtml">Restaurant: Quince</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> While the new location is somewhat fancier than the previous location, it remains a perfect dining situation. </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/03/restaurant_cotogna.shtml">Restaurant: Cotogna</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> This restaurant is literally next door to Quince. Cotogna is much more casual and is described as an Italian trattoria.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/03/restaurant_kokkari.shtml">Restaurant: Kokkari</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> You enter this restaurant at a far corner of a large dining room that turns out to be one of two large dining rooms.  The restaurant has a variety of private rooms that  can become part of the main restaurant. </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/03/restaurant_cliff_house.shtml">Restaurant: Cliff House</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> Cliff House has several observation areas and it is worth checking out each of them.  On this particular day there were no seals in evidence, but an endless number of birds were hanging out on the various islands.  </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2011/05/restaurant_morimoto.shtml">Restaurant: Morimoto</a></h3>

<p><em>Napa, California:</em> The restaurant is quite large and very modern in design.		You can stop and watch the kitchen in action, but there is a lot of traffic as dishes are conveyed from the kitchen to diners.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2011/05/restaurant_bistro_jeanty.shtml">Restaurant: Bistro Jeanty</a></h3>

<p><em>Yountville, California:</em> As you enter the restaurant there is a small reception desk.	To the right there is a community table that seats up to 12, as well as several smaller tables.	At the far end of this first room there is a bar with six tall chairs.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2011/05/restaurant_the_richmond_restau.shtml">Restaurant: The Richmond Restaurant & Wine Bar</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> This is a relatively small neighborhood restaurant.	Our table was by itself, in a corner to the right of the entrance.	</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2011/05/restaurant_perbacco.shtml">Restaurant: Perbacco</a></h3>

<p><em>San Francisco:</em> Perbacco is quite large.	To the left of the entry is a long, L-shaped bar with many high chairs.	There are also several high, round tables with related chairs at the front.</p>
