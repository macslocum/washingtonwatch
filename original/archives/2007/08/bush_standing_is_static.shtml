<p></p>
President Bush cannot buy a break. An initiative in which he
invested a lot of capital, immigration legislation, may well now be off
the table until 2009. His Administration, including many on his current
or &nbsp;former White
House staff, are being investigated by a variety of
Congressional Committees. He is in the middle of a
major confrontation with the Senate and House Judiciary
Committees on certain claims of Executive privilege.<br>
<br>
The last time President Bush had an approval rating of over 40% in a
major public survey was 12/11/06, when the LATimes/Bloomberg poll had
his approval at 40% and
his disapproval at 56%. In the most recent LATimes/Bloomberg
survey, taken in early June, his approval
rating was 34%. <br>
<br>
In 6 surveys taken between July 7th and July 18th, the President had an
average approval rating of 32% and a disapproval rating of
63%. [Real Clear Politics] <br>
<br>
Compared to the low points of other 2-term Presidents in the last 50
years, at this point in their Administrations, Bush continues to reside
in the cellar. <br>

<br>
In the 2nd week of June, the NBC/WSJ found that only 32% of Americans
felt even somewhat favorable toward the President. More
recently, in a mid-July
Gallup survey, 37% gave the President a favorable nod. <br>
<br>
There has been little or no improvement in the ratings of his job
performance on specific issues, such as Iraq, immigration, the economy,
and the campaign against
terrorism. <br>
<br>
64% of Americans believed that the President should not veto the stem
cell research bill, but he did anyway. [Gallup 6/07] <br>
<br>
To date, Bush has only issued 3 vetoes. This is far fewer
than any modern President, but he still has 18 months to go. <br>

<h2>The Vice President</h2>
Vice President Cheney marches to his own drummer. He clearly
takes positions and speaks out with absolutely no concern about how the
media, most of the public, or
even the Congress may react. Could it have anything to do with the fact
that he is the only Vice
President, at least going back to 1952, who did not have the potential
for or any expectation that he
might run for President in his own right? <br>
<br>
Only 30% approve of the job that Cheney is doing, and the same number
have a favorable opinion of him. These are both low points
for Cheney. At his
high point, in early 2002, 68% approved of the job he was doing, and
67% felt favorably toward him. [Gallup 1/02,
7/07]
