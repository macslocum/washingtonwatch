<h2>The Field: And Then There Were ... </h2>
19 Republicans, 17 Democrats, and 1 Green Party candidate have made
some kind of noise or another about running for President in
2008.&nbsp; In addition,
there is at least one potential Independent candidate, Michael
Bloomberg, who, while he has not suggested he might
run, his folks have made noises in that direction. <br>
<br>
Among the Republicans (19) <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>10 filed campaign committee (1 has since quit the race) </li>
  <li>4 got out of the game before starting </li>
  <li>1 suggested she will start campaign in September </li>
  <li>3 have said "wait and see" </li>
  <li>1 has said nothing </li>
</ul>
Among the Democrats (17) <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>9 filed campaign committees (1 has since quit the race) </li>
  <li>5 got out of the game before starting </li>
  <li>3 have said "wait and see" </li>
</ul>
The potential Green Party candidate has said "wait and see."&nbsp;
The most talked about possible Independent candidate is simply keeping
open his option.&nbsp; So far he has made no Shermanesque
statements. <br>

<h2>Qualities we want in our Candidates</h2>
In the June NBC/WSJ survey, Republicans, or respondents who said they
would vote in the Republican primary (as Republicans), and Democrats,
or respondents who said they would vote in the Democratic primary (as
Democrats), were asked which 1 or 2 of a list of qualities they want in
the nominees for President. <br>
<br>
The two groups had different priorities.&nbsp; Republicans put at
the top of their list "Being knowledgeable and experienced enough to
handle the Presidency."&nbsp; Democrats selected as their #1
"Bringing real change to the direction of the country."<br>
<br>
The following are the priorities selected by the two groups. How do the
scores for Americans generally match your own judgements? <br>

African-American President.&nbsp; 79% have the same view about a

<h2>The Primaries</h2>
Not much has changed in the Democratic field.&nbsp; Clinton, Obama
and Edwards still lead the pack. 83% of Democrats, including leaners,
are satisfied with the field. <br>
<br>
But there has been substantial change in the Republican
field.&nbsp; McCain has faded, and Fred Thompson, who has yet to
declare his candidacy, is running 2nd in some surveys.&nbsp; 65%,
including leaners, are satisfied with the field. <br>

<h2>The Democratic Primaries</h2>
Just to add a little perspective or a topic for chatter around the
water cooler... <br>
<br>
Do you recall who was leading in the Democratic primary in 1999 about
this time?&nbsp; Do you recall who was leading in the Democratic
primary at this time in 2003? <br>
<br>
WW asked at least 30 savvy, political junkies one or both of these
questions over a several week period.&nbsp; (Pollsters were not
included in the respondent group.) <br>
<br>
One person answered the 1999 question correctly.&nbsp; 2 people
answered the 2003 question correctly, one of whom worked for the person
who was leading in the polls at that time. <br>

not quite so strong as her national position. <br>

<h2>The Republican Primaries</h2>
The Republican field has experienced some pretty dramatic changes in
recent months. <br>
<br>
John McCain's campaign has faltered badly and so has his standing among
Republican voters.&nbsp; In December he had the support of 28% of
Republicans in the Gallup survey, tied with Giuliani for the lead. Now
he is at 16%.<br>
<br>
Fred Thompson, who has yet to officially announce (not until
September), is now clearly in 2nd place.&nbsp; Given how well he is
doing without being an active candidate, some might argue he should
stay out as long as possible. <br>
<br>
Giuliani continues to lead the Republican field with 37%, followed by
McCain (16%), Fred Thompson (15%), and Romney (8%). <br>
<br>
In a 6-survey average of polls taken from July 9-18: Giuliani 25,
Thompson 20, McCain 13.5, and Romney 10.&nbsp; As with Gore on the
Democratic lists, some surveys include Newt Gingrich, even though he
has said he will not make a decision until the Fall. <br>
<br>
It is unlikely that Gingrich will become a candidate, especially since
he has the highest unfavorable rating among Republicans of any of the
top candidates, at 32%. <br>
<br>
Giuliani's position in the various State races is not as strong as
Clinton's. <br>
<br>
The following are averages of 2 or more polls taken during the
referenced periods.&nbsp; Giuliani has the lead in 4 of the 8
States listed, and is tied in the 5th.&nbsp; Romney leads in the
other 3 States. <br>

Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents who support Giuliani
tend to be somewhat less conservative than the average Republican
voters, especially on social issues.&nbsp; But even at that, they
are pretty conservative.&nbsp; Yet 74% of this group say that
Giuliani is an acceptable nominee for the Republican party.&nbsp;
He stands above Thompson (59%), McCain (57%), Romney (53%).&nbsp;

In 2 mid-July surveys Fred Thompson's favorables are stronger than his
unfavorable, but more than half the folks interviewed had not heard of
him or, if they had heard of him, don't know enough to have an opinion.
<br>
<br>
In the CBS/NYT survey of July 9-17, 17% view him favorably and 11%
unfavorably.&nbsp; 52% had not heard of him and another 20% were
undecided. <br>
<br>
Gallup's July 12-15 survey found him to have favorables of 28%;

<h2>The Money Primary</h2>
Barack Obama is the clear winner of the 2nd "election" of the money
primary, which ended on June 30th.&nbsp; Obama raised more money in
total, more money for the primary, had more net cash on hand, and had
far more contributors than anyone else in either Party.&nbsp; The
one area in which he failed to lead was in spending; he came in 2nd. <br>
<br>
Obama raised $32,907,000, of which $31,200,000 can be used in the
primaries.&nbsp; He had $32,700,000 net cash available and has a
total of 258,000 contributors.&nbsp; He spent $16,700,000. <br>
<br>
Clinton finished 2nd, having raised $27,000,000, of which $21,364,000
can be used in the primaries. She had $29,600,000 net cash available
and spent $13,671,000 in the quarter.&nbsp; The total number of her
contributors was not readily available. <br>
<br>
Giuliani was 3rd in this race, having raised $17,470,000, of which
$13,760,000 can be spent on the primaries.&nbsp; He had $14,600,000
net cash available and spent $10,900,000 in the 2nd quarter. <br>
<br>
Romney brought in $14,000,000, all of which can be used in the
primaries, to finish 4th.&nbsp; In addition, he lent his campaign
an additional $6,500,000.&nbsp; This results in his having
$12,000,000 in net cash available.&nbsp; He was the clear spending
leader, having shelled out $18,200,000 this quarter. <br>
<br>
The 1st half year and the 2nd quarter in general has proved to be a
disaster for McCain.&nbsp; He raised $11,470,000, of which
$9,965,000 can be spent on the primaries.&nbsp; However, he spent
$12,200,000, and finished the quarter with net cash available of
$166,000 (this is not an error). <br>
<br>
John Edwards is running behind in the fundraising chase, but he is also
spending money more carefully than most of the others. He took in
$9,030,000, of which $7,730,000 can be used in the primaries. He spent
about $6,400,000, leaving himself with net cash available of a very
respectable $12,000,000. <br>
<br>
Of the remaining Democratic candidates, Dodd had about $5,000,000 net
cash available, Richards $7,000,000, and Biden $1,900,000.&nbsp;
Biden will likely have the most difficulty raising additional money,
and it is likely that his campaign will literally run out of gas by
Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Dodd and Richardson will have sufficient funds
to arrive at the caucus/primary season still standing. <br>
<br>
Kucinich had just over $200,000 net cash available at the end of the
quarter.&nbsp; He can't go on for too long with that "war chest,"
but he will be able to afford to attend the debates as long as he is
included. <br>
<br>

<h2>The Maxed-Out Givers Derby</h2>
More than half of the total Presidential campaign primary funds raised
by the 3 leading candidates in each Party comes from so-called

Thompson is not included because he has yet to file a committee with

Fred Thompson has been raising money and putting together a staff, but
he does not intend to announce his candidacy or apparently to file a
committee with the Federal Election Commission until
September.&nbsp; Even before his announcement there has been a
shakeup at the top of his campaign. <br>
<br>
While there is some disagreement among campaign finance lawyers as to
whether it is necessary, Thompson's "testing the waters committee"
plans to file with the IRS on July 31st.&nbsp; This will cover
income and expenses through June 30th.&nbsp; Since the bulk of his
fundraising has come after July 1st, this report will not tell us much.

greater support to the Democratic candidate. <br>

In recent polls married voters have generally rated Republican
candidates more favorably than unmarried voters. However, at least two
of the leading Democratic candidates, Obama and Edwards, do better with
married voters than has been typical for Democratic candidates. <br>

<h2>A Bloomberg Candidacy?</h2>
Will he or won't he?&nbsp; That seems to be the multi-billion
dollar question.&nbsp; Will Mike Bloomberg, successful businessman,
philanthropist, and currently serving as 2nd term Mayor of New York
City, decide to run for President as an Independent? <br>
<br>
On one of his recent shows, George Stephanopoulos reported on a
conversation with an aide to the New York Mayor.&nbsp; The aide
said there is a 4-part test that Bloomberg will use next February, to
decide whether to enter the race, after it is clear who the Democrats
and Republicans will pick as their nominees. <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>70% of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong
direction </li>
  <br>
  <li>Both candidates have unfavorable ratings in the 40s </li>
  <br>
  <li>60% of the country is open to a 3rd party </li>
  <br>
  <li>20-25% Americans are open to Mike Bloomberg</li>
</ol>
Recently, Bloomberg, who had been a registered Democrat and became a
registered Republican in order to run as a Republican for Mayor,
changed his registration once again, and is now an Independent. There
is some suggestion that the move was made because it is difficult to
get on some State ballots as an Independent if you are registered as a
member of a Party in another State. <br>
<br>
Certainly, the Bloomberg "team" has done the research necessary to know
what it takes to get on the ballot as an Independent. <br>
<br>
There are several things that will work for Bloomberg if he decides to
enter the race. <br>
<br>
He can self-fund without giving it a second thought.&nbsp; He has
twice won election to the top office in an essentially
Democratic-controlled city.&nbsp; He has proved in New York that he
will move ahead with solutions to problems whether or not those
solutions are politically popular at the outset.&nbsp; He brings
top notch, if somewhat unconventional, folks into government.&nbsp;
If he loses, he already knows what he wants to do next. <br>
<br>
And finally, the positive rating of the Democratic Party is 32%, down
from its most recent high of 50% in January 2000.&nbsp; And the
positive rating of the Republican Party is at 28%, down from its recent
December 2001 high of 57%. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
A Pew Research Center study found that 65% of Americans had heard of
Bloomberg, more at that time than could identify Romney, Biden, Fred
Thompson, Richardson, Dodd, or a number of others.&nbsp; On the
other hand, 99% could identify Clinton, 90% Giuliani, 89% McCain, 87%
Edwards, and 85% Obama. <br>
<br>
Of registered voters who had heard of each candidate only 9% said there
was a good chance they would vote for Bloomberg (31% said there was a
good or at least some chance they would vote for him). <br>
<br>
28% good chance they would vote for Clinton <br>

<br>
14% good chance would vote for Romney <br>

52% of Independents and Republicans and 63% of Democrats said there was

and Harvard (during the full month of May), 77% of Independents said
they would seriously consider an Independent Presidential candidate,

<br>
In a 3-way race, the July 8th USAToday/Gallup survey showed Clinton
leading with 43%, followed by Giuliani at 38%, and Bloomberg at 12%. <br>
<br>
Two national, general election surveys were taken between 6/20-24/07 by
CNN and Newsweek. Averaging those two surveys in a head-to-head race,
Clinton leads Giuliani by 50%-46%.&nbsp; In a 3-way contest that
includes Bloomberg, the result is Clinton 43.5%, Giuliani 37.5%,
Bloomberg 14%. <br>
<br>
In a Quinnipiac University poll taken in early July, Giuliani leads
Clinton in a head-to-head contest 47%-44%.&nbsp; However, if
Bloomberg enters the race, he takes 18% in a 3-way race, and Giuliani
and Clinton are tied at 36%. <br>

One added incentive is the fact that a majority of Americans (58%)
think that the two main political Parties do such a poor job that a
third major Party is needed.&nbsp; [USAToday/Gallup 7/07] <br>

To take a look at the landscape for an Independent candidate WW did the
following: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> created, State by State, an average % for the Democratic
and
Republican Presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004</li>
  <br>
  <li> placed the 50 States and D.C. into 4 groupings</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> States won by either party by:</li>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> 20 points or more - 135 electoral votes (includes New
York's 31 electoral votes)</li>
      <br>
      <li> 15-19 points - 51 electoral votes</li>
      <br>
      <li> 10-14 points - 139 electoral votes</li>
      <br>
      <li> 0-9 points - 213 electoral votes</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Keep in mind that to win a State does not require a majority of the
votes or even a near majority. Acquiring the electoral votes for a
given state (other than Maine and Nebraska) only requires that a
candidate get 1 more vote than any other candidate.&nbsp; A
candidate getting 34% of the vote, wins if no other candidate reaches
that number. <br>
<br>
It seems all but impossible for an Independent candidate to win in a
State that was won by the Democratic or Republican Presidential
candidates by 20 points or more.&nbsp; [135 votes] <br>
<br>
It seems very unlikely that an Independent candidate would come through
in States that were won by one Democratic or Republican Presidential
candidate or another by 15-19 points.&nbsp; [51 votes] <br>
<br>
That leaves 352 electoral votes in States in which the Democratic or
Republican Presidential candidates won by an average of 14% points or
less.&nbsp; It is from this group of States that an Independent
candidate must find the 270 votes he/she needs to be elected.&nbsp;
[Of that 352 votes, 139 votes are in States which were won by 10-14
points by one Party or the other.] <br>
<br>
While it is the case that the minimum number of States required to win
the election in the electoral college is 11 (California, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas), 3 of those States are probably off the
table. For details about each State and the 4 groupings see <a

3</a>.
