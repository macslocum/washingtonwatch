<h1>Sarabeth's Kitchen (East) </h1>
At the Hotel Wales<br>
1295 Madison Avenue <br>
New York, NYC 10128</div><i>Guest review by Carol Berman</i>
<p>
I went to New York for the day with a few girls, stayed at the Hotel Wales, and felt that WW readers should share the experience.  The rooms in the hotel are very small, but it's comfortable, quiet, located near good shops, restaurants, and museums (at 92nd and Madison), and perhaps best of all, houses Sarabeth's. 
<p>
Sarabeth's has branches at the Whitney Museum and on the West Side, and also is known for wonderful jams that are sold around the country (in DC, a good place to buy them is Rodman's). 
<p>
I was joined at lunch by Anne, Sharon, Jo Anne, Nancy, and Lou.  Lunch selections were typical fare for ladies who lunch (chopped seasonal vegetables with field greens, bleu cheese, and sherry vinaigrette; roasted chicken salad with walnuts, and chives; grilled tuna nicoise with baby greens, grilled red onions, baby carrots, haricot vert, and roasted shallot vinaigrette). Iced tea is served in a generous pitcher and is lightly flavored with mango. 
<p>
There is a daily market soup, and the plates arriving at nearby tables also looked very appealing: chicken pot pie, one great burger, jumbo lump crabcake sandwich (served with a mound of matchstick fries, salad of red beets, watercress, apples, and pears), and some great looking desserts. 
<p>
We lingered for two hours without the threat of being displaced, and thought the atmosphere was entirely pleasant. 
<p>
On the following morning, I had "staggered" breakfast with Anne, Rita, and Lou.  Sarabeth's is famous for its extraordinary breakfasts, which include "Four Flowers Juice" (a blend of orange, pineapple, bananas, and pomegranate juice), a variety of cereals, eggs, omelettes, muffins, and croissants.  Anne had "Popeye" eggs with spinach, while Rita and I ordered from the "three bears porridge" selections.  Lou was along for the conversation, having picked up an early continental breakfast from the hotel's second floor lobby. 
<p>
There is a small dining area upstairs, and a combination of booths and tables at street level.  The two unisex bathrooms are a few steps up from the restaurant, at the lobby level of the hotel.  Both bathrooms have a sign "for single occupancy."  One is a small bathroom with an ordinary commode and sink.  The other could accommodate at least six people, and, in addition 
to the commode and sink, is cheerily decorated with red floral wallpaper, a very large carved-wood framed mirror that probably once resided over a fireplace in a ballroom, and an antique sewing machine table that holds a stack of high-quality paper towels. 
<p>
Sarabeth's offers breakfast (8-5:30 M-F), afternoon tea (3:30-5:30 M-F), dinner (5:30-10:30 M-Sat and 5:30-9:30 on Sunday), and brunch (8-4 on Sundays).

<h1>BLT Steak</h1>
1625 I Street NW 
Washington, D.C. 
202-689-8999 
<a href="http://bltsteak.com">bltsteak.com</a></div>My first visit to BLT was dinner with Carol, 
Virginia and Tom.  My second visit was for lunch with Maya. 
<p>
BLT is part of a group of restaurants that began in New York.  In some ways it is another steak house, but in many ways it is different. As you enter there is a large bar straight ahead and to the left.  The "L" of the bar closest to front door is a raw bar.  The bar seats about a dozen folks on high back stools. 
<p>
The restaurant seats 130 people at capacity.  The floors are wood and the table coverings are place mats.  There is a banquette that runs about the length of and parallel to the bar, just to the right of the entry way.  There are seats on both sides of the banquette.  There is also an L-shaped banquette on the bar side of the restaurant. 
<p>
* Small starters are provided to the table, including warm, chopped liver in a small casserole with toast rounds; various finely sliced meats; pickled vegetables; humongous popovers 
<p>
* Appetizers - Carol - tuna tartare / avocado / soy-lime dressing comes in a square tower; Virginia - beef steak tomatoes, grilled onion vinaigrette; Tom- field greens/mustard dressing; Mike - roasted beets/fresh goat cheese. 
<p>
* Main courses - Tom and Virginia split a sirloin for two; Carol - soft shell crabs; Mike - black sea bass. 
<p>
* Sides for the table - french fries, onion rings, creamy spinach. 
<p>
* Dessert: Mike - Demike lemon sorbet; Virginia - chocolate tort. 
<p>
The service was excellent.  As the evening wore on (we arrived at 7:00 pm) it got quite noisy, like so many large restaurants. Subsequently, I went to BLT for lunch with  Maya. 
<p>
Maya had tuna, followed by peanut butter chocolate mousse with banana ice cream.  I started with a Caesar salad.  There was plenty of crisp lettuce and about the right amount of dressing, without added cheese, of course.  That 
was followed by appetizer- sized portions of a shrimp cocktail and a crab meat cocktail.  I also had a side of spinach and 1 scoop of pistachio ice cream.  It had a nice creamy texture without that frozen quality. 
<p>
The men's room is new and fresh like the restaurant.  The decor is black and white.  To the right, as you come through the heavy, dark wood door, are 3 prints at eye level.  To the left is a black marble counter top with 2 white ceramic sinks.  Over the sinks there is a large black framed mirror.  Continuing on the left are 2 wall-hanging urinals, with partial black shiny dividers between them.
<p>
Directly ahead as you enter is a completely enclosed, accessible commode area.  What makes this particular area unique is that it also has a washbasin and mirror. 
<p>
The floor is covered in large black tiles.  The wall behind the urinals and in the commode area is covered by medium sized white tiles, to about 4 feet tall.  The rest of the walls are painted a not-too-shiny white.  The ceiling is covered with 
large, absorbent material white tiles. 
<p>
Reservations are generally necessary.

<p>
There were 7 of us in your editor's first visit to this restaurant: Mike M, Sherry, Heidi, Sarabeth, Sam, Carol, and me. 
<p>
The main dining room seats about 75 people at tables ranging from 2s to 7s.  There is also a separate room near the front of the restaurant that houses a free-standing bar and several small tables. 
<p>
One thing sets this restaurant aside from every other restaurant reviewed in WW over the years.  On the individual menus distributed at the restaurant, and on the website, there are nutrition facts for each of the dishes served at the restaurant.  More about that a little later. 
<p>

<p>
<li> Heidi - Curried Lobster Bisque with fresh fava beans, coconut milk, cilantro;

<p>
<li> Sam - Grilled All-Natural Chicken Breast with lemon-pepper spaetzle, baby french beans, carrots, chicken jus;  
<p>
<li> Mike - Jumbo Lump Crabcakes with celeriac-apple slaw, lemon-caper aioli; 
<p>
<li> Carol and Sarabeth - 5oz Grilled Filet Mignon with roasted sunchokes, jumbo asparagus, thyme jus; (another nice feature of the menu is that the filet comes in 5oz and 8oz sizes). 
</ul>
<p>
Dessert:  
<ul>
<li> Carol - Raspberries with Honey Yogurt; 
<p>
<li> Sherry and Heidi - Rock Creek Chocolate Cake with Light Whipped Cream;

<p>
Now for the nutrition counts for each person in our party. 
<ul>
<li> Mike M - 677 Calories/39% fat; 
<p>
<li> Sherry - 658 calories/51% fat; 
<p>
<li> Heidi - 923 calories/37% fat; 
<p>
<li> Sarabeth - 428 calories/36% fat; 
<p>

<p>
<li> Carol - 715 calories/42% fat; 
<p>
<li> Mike B - 990 calories/38% fat. 
</ul>
The service was excellent and the various courses came in a timely fashion even though the restaurant was nearly full. 
<p>
There is a 3-course tasting menu several nights a week, but you can order individual items from that menu. 
<p>
The men's room is simple, clean and functional.  As you enter there is a white ceramic washbasin on the right.  Next is a white ceramic urinal, separated from the washbasin by a partial brown metal, wall-hanging divider.  Next in line is a very large commode area, fully accessible and separated from the rest of the room by a partial brown metal wall and door, open at top and bottom.  There is also a column of small metal lockers within the commode area. 
<p>
The floor is covered with medium-sized white tiles.  There are smaller tan tiles covering the walls from the floor to a height of 3.5 feet.  The rest of the walls and the ceiling are painted brown. 
<p>
Heidi reports that the women's room is very nice. 
<p>
There is valet parking (but not during July and August). Reservations are recommended. 
<p>
The owners of this restaurant are opening a second restaurant on the theater level of The Mazza Gallerie on upper Wisconsin Avenue.  It is scheduled to open around July 15th.

<h2>Wisdom from Saul Turteltaub</h2>
Old is when you can't remember your wife's married name. Really old is
when you can't remember where you parked your car and you're still in
it. <br>

"Agreement on politics" is least important on a list of 9 items
associated with successful marriages. Only 12% think it is important. <br>
<br>
Topping the list is "faithfulness," which 93% say is
important.&nbsp; Moving up on the list, with the largest jump since
1990, is "sharing household chores," which now ranks 3rd, with 62%
listing it.&nbsp; It has jumped 15 points since 1990.&nbsp;

A large majority of Americans think that people spend too much money on
their weddings.&nbsp; And most of them don't know the half of
it.&nbsp; When asked how much the average American wedding costs,
the mean answer was $13,609.&nbsp; In fact, the average wedding
costs $27,490. <br>
<br>
And how much should you be spending on a wedding gift for a friend or
relative?&nbsp; The average of the responses was $110, with men
tending to be about 1.6 times more generous than women.&nbsp;

<h2>One Hundred Years Ago</h2>
Most women washed their hair only once a month, and used
borax or egg yolks for shampoo. <br>
<br>
The five leading causes of death in the U.S. were: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Pneumonia and influenza </li>
  <li>Tuberculosis </li>
  <li>Diarrhea </li>
  <li>Heart disease </li>
  <li>Stroke </li>
</ul>
The average U.S. worker made between $200 and $400 per
year.&nbsp; A competent accountant could expect to earn $2,000 per
year; a dentist $2,500 per year; a
veterinarian between $1,500 and $4,000 per year; and a mechanical
engineer about $5,000 per year. <br>
<br>
Marijuana, heroin, and morphine were all available, over the
counter, at the local corner drugstore! <br>
<br>
Crossword puzzles, canned beer, and iced tea hadn't been
invented yet. <br>
<br>
Only 6% of all Americans had graduated from high school. <br>

Earlier in July, Americans were asked&nbsp; their opinion of the
two largest political parties. Republicans were rated favorably by 38%
and unfavorably by 56%. Democrats on the other hand were rated
favorably by 52% and unfavorably by 41%. [CBS/NYT 7/07] Both parties
have roughly the same ratings as they did last October before the
Democrats took over the House and Senate. <br>
<br>
The job performance approval rating of the Congress and of each of the
parties members of the Congress are nothing special. <br>

<h2>U.S. House of Representatives</h2>
Currently the Democrats control the House with a 231 to 202 margin.
There are currently 2 vacancies (2D) with special elections pending.
These seats are not likely to change in terms of party. <br>
<br>
There are so far 3 open Democratic seats come the 2008 election. All
three are likely to remain in Democratic hands. There is 1 open
Republican seat at the end of the term and it is likely to stay
Republican.<br>
<br>
There are a variety of potentially open seats with most of them
currently being held by Republicans. However, many of those potentially
open seats will not be open once decisions are made about which of the
current House members are going to run for the Senate. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h2>U.S. Senate</h2>
There has been little change in the Senate environment during the last
couple of months. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) appears to be in better shape. <br>
<br>
There is still the possibility that Mike Huckabee (R) will drop his
presidential bid and decide to take on Mark Prior (D-AR). <br>
<br>
Everyone is waiting the return to the Senate of Tom Johnson (D-SD). The
latest information is that he will return after the August recess. <br>
<br>
In New Hampshire, folks continue to try and get Jeanne Shaheen to take
on John Sununu (R-NH). So far she has repulsed all entreaties. <br>
<br>
John Warner (R-VA) is expected to announce shortly after Labor Day
whether he will be a candidate for re-election. If he chooses not to
run this is a potential pickup for the Democrats. <br>
<br>
And, it remains to be seen whether Pete Dominici (R-NM) may be
vulnerable. <br>

<h2>Qualities we want in our Candidates</h2>
In the June NBC/WSJ survey, Republicans, or respondents who said they
would vote in the Republican primary (as Republicans), and Democrats,
or respondents who said they would vote in the Democratic primary (as
Democrats), were asked which 1 or 2 of a list of qualities they want in
the nominees for President. <br>
<br>
The two groups had different priorities.&nbsp; Republicans put at
the top of their list "Being knowledgeable and experienced enough to
handle the Presidency."&nbsp; Democrats selected as their #1
"Bringing real change to the direction of the country."<br>
<br>
The following are the priorities selected by the two groups. How do the
scores for Americans generally match your own judgements? <br>

Not much has changed in the Democratic field.&nbsp; Clinton, Obama

Just to add a little perspective or a topic for chatter around the

<br>
Do you recall who was leading in the Democratic primary in 1999 about
this time?&nbsp; Do you recall who was leading in the Democratic
primary at this time in 2003? <br>
<br>
WW asked at least 30 savvy, political junkies one or both of these
questions over a several week period.&nbsp; (Pollsters were not
included in the respondent group.) <br>
<br>
One person answered the 1999 question correctly.&nbsp; 2 people
answered the 2003 question correctly, one of whom worked for the person
who was leading in the polls at that time. <br>

not quite so strong as her national position. <br>

<h2>The Republican Primaries</h2>
The Republican field has experienced some pretty dramatic changes in
recent months. <br>
<br>
John McCain's campaign has faltered badly and so has his standing among
Republican voters.&nbsp; In December he had the support of 28% of
Republicans in the Gallup survey, tied with Giuliani for the lead. Now
he is at 16%.<br>
<br>
Fred Thompson, who has yet to officially announce (not until
September), is now clearly in 2nd place.&nbsp; Given how well he is
doing without being an active candidate, some might argue he should
stay out as long as possible. <br>
<br>
Giuliani continues to lead the Republican field with 37%, followed by
McCain (16%), Fred Thompson (15%), and Romney (8%). <br>
<br>
In a 6-survey average of polls taken from July 9-18: Giuliani 25,
Thompson 20, McCain 13.5, and Romney 10.&nbsp; As with Gore on the
Democratic lists, some surveys include Newt Gingrich, even though he
has said he will not make a decision until the Fall. <br>
<br>
It is unlikely that Gingrich will become a candidate, especially since
he has the highest unfavorable rating among Republicans of any of the
top candidates, at 32%. <br>
<br>
Giuliani's position in the various State races is not as strong as
Clinton's. <br>
<br>
The following are averages of 2 or more polls taken during the
referenced periods.&nbsp; Giuliani has the lead in 4 of the 8
States listed, and is tied in the 5th.&nbsp; Romney leads in the
other 3 States. <br>

Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents who support Giuliani
tend to be somewhat less conservative than the average Republican
voters, especially on social issues.&nbsp; But even at that, they
are pretty conservative.&nbsp; Yet 74% of this group say that
Giuliani is an acceptable nominee for the Republican party.&nbsp;
He stands above Thompson (59%), McCain (57%), Romney (53%).&nbsp;

In 2 mid-July surveys Fred Thompson's favorables are stronger than his
unfavorable, but more than half the folks interviewed had not heard of
him or, if they had heard of him, don't know enough to have an opinion.
<br>
<br>
In the CBS/NYT survey of July 9-17, 17% view him favorably and 11%
unfavorably.&nbsp; 52% had not heard of him and another 20% were
undecided. <br>
<br>
Gallup's July 12-15 survey found him to have favorables of 28%;

<h2>The Money Primary</h2>
Barack Obama is the clear winner of the 2nd "election" of the money
primary, which ended on June 30th.&nbsp; Obama raised more money in
total, more money for the primary, had more net cash on hand, and had
far more contributors than anyone else in either Party.&nbsp; The
one area in which he failed to lead was in spending; he came in 2nd. <br>
<br>
Obama raised $32,907,000, of which $31,200,000 can be used in the
primaries.&nbsp; He had $32,700,000 net cash available and has a
total of 258,000 contributors.&nbsp; He spent $16,700,000. <br>
<br>
Clinton finished 2nd, having raised $27,000,000, of which $21,364,000
can be used in the primaries. She had $29,600,000 net cash available
and spent $13,671,000 in the quarter.&nbsp; The total number of her
contributors was not readily available. <br>
<br>
Giuliani was 3rd in this race, having raised $17,470,000, of which
$13,760,000 can be spent on the primaries.&nbsp; He had $14,600,000
net cash available and spent $10,900,000 in the 2nd quarter. <br>
<br>
Romney brought in $14,000,000, all of which can be used in the
primaries, to finish 4th.&nbsp; In addition, he lent his campaign
an additional $6,500,000.&nbsp; This results in his having
$12,000,000 in net cash available.&nbsp; He was the clear spending
leader, having shelled out $18,200,000 this quarter. <br>
<br>
The 1st half year and the 2nd quarter in general has proved to be a
disaster for McCain.&nbsp; He raised $11,470,000, of which
$9,965,000 can be spent on the primaries.&nbsp; However, he spent
$12,200,000, and finished the quarter with net cash available of
$166,000 (this is not an error). <br>
<br>
John Edwards is running behind in the fundraising chase, but he is also
spending money more carefully than most of the others. He took in
$9,030,000, of which $7,730,000 can be used in the primaries. He spent
about $6,400,000, leaving himself with net cash available of a very
respectable $12,000,000. <br>
<br>
Of the remaining Democratic candidates, Dodd had about $5,000,000 net
cash available, Richards $7,000,000, and Biden $1,900,000.&nbsp;
Biden will likely have the most difficulty raising additional money,
and it is likely that his campaign will literally run out of gas by
Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Dodd and Richardson will have sufficient funds
to arrive at the caucus/primary season still standing. <br>
<br>
Kucinich had just over $200,000 net cash available at the end of the
quarter.&nbsp; He can't go on for too long with that "war chest,"
but he will be able to afford to attend the debates as long as he is
included. <br>
<br>
Full details of fundraising to date can be found at <a

<h2>The Maxed-Out Givers Derby</h2>
More than half of the total Presidential campaign primary funds raised

Thompson is not included because he has yet to file a committee with

Fred Thompson has been raising money and putting together a staff, but
he does not intend to announce his candidacy or apparently to file a
committee with the Federal Election Commission until
September.&nbsp; Even before his announcement there has been a
shakeup at the top of his campaign. <br>
<br>
While there is some disagreement among campaign finance lawyers as to
whether it is necessary, Thompson's "testing the waters committee"
plans to file with the IRS on July 31st.&nbsp; This will cover
income and expenses through June 30th.&nbsp; Since the bulk of his
fundraising has come after July 1st, this report will not tell us much.

greater support to the Democratic candidate. <br>

In recent polls married voters have generally rated Republican
candidates more favorably than unmarried voters. However, at least two

<h2>A Bloomberg Candidacy?</h2>
Will he or won't he?&nbsp; That seems to be the multi-billion
dollar question.&nbsp; Will Mike Bloomberg, successful businessman,
philanthropist, and currently serving as 2nd term Mayor of New York
City, decide to run for President as an Independent? <br>
<br>
On one of his recent shows, George Stephanopoulos reported on a
conversation with an aide to the New York Mayor.&nbsp; The aide
said there is a 4-part test that Bloomberg will use next February, to
decide whether to enter the race, after it is clear who the Democrats
and Republicans will pick as their nominees. <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>70% of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong
direction </li>
  <br>
  <li>Both candidates have unfavorable ratings in the 40s </li>
  <br>
  <li>60% of the country is open to a 3rd party </li>
  <br>
  <li>20-25% Americans are open to Mike Bloomberg</li>
</ol>
Recently, Bloomberg, who had been a registered Democrat and became a
registered Republican in order to run as a Republican for Mayor,
changed his registration once again, and is now an Independent. There
is some suggestion that the move was made because it is difficult to
get on some State ballots as an Independent if you are registered as a
member of a Party in another State. <br>
<br>
Certainly, the Bloomberg "team" has done the research necessary to know
what it takes to get on the ballot as an Independent. <br>
<br>
There are several things that will work for Bloomberg if he decides to
enter the race. <br>
<br>
He can self-fund without giving it a second thought.&nbsp; He has
twice won election to the top office in an essentially
Democratic-controlled city.&nbsp; He has proved in New York that he
will move ahead with solutions to problems whether or not those
solutions are politically popular at the outset.&nbsp; He brings
top notch, if somewhat unconventional, folks into government.&nbsp;
If he loses, he already knows what he wants to do next. <br>
<br>
And finally, the positive rating of the Democratic Party is 32%, down
from its most recent high of 50% in January 2000.&nbsp; And the
positive rating of the Republican Party is at 28%, down from its recent
December 2001 high of 57%. <br>
<br>

A Pew Research Center study found that 65% of Americans had heard of

other hand, 99% could identify Clinton, 90% Giuliani, 89% McCain, 87%
Edwards, and 85% Obama. <br>
<br>
Of registered voters who had heard of each candidate only 9% said there
was a good chance they would vote for Bloomberg (31% said there was a
good or at least some chance they would vote for him). <br>

In a 3-way race, the July 8th USAToday/Gallup survey showed Clinton
leading with 43%, followed by Giuliani at 38%, and Bloomberg at 12%. <br>
<br>
Two national, general election surveys were taken between 6/20-24/07 by
CNN and Newsweek. Averaging those two surveys in a head-to-head race,
Clinton leads Giuliani by 50%-46%.&nbsp; In a 3-way contest that
includes Bloomberg, the result is Clinton 43.5%, Giuliani 37.5%,
Bloomberg 14%. <br>
<br>
In a Quinnipiac University poll taken in early July, Giuliani leads
Clinton in a head-to-head contest 47%-44%.&nbsp; However, if
Bloomberg enters the race, he takes 18% in a 3-way race, and Giuliani
and Clinton are tied at 36%. <br>

One added incentive is the fact that a majority of Americans (58%)
think that the two main political Parties do such a poor job that a
third major Party is needed.&nbsp; [USAToday/Gallup 7/07] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
To take a look at the landscape for an Independent candidate WW did the
following: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> created, State by State, an average % for the Democratic
and
Republican Presidential candidates in 2000 and 2004</li>
  <br>
  <li> placed the 50 States and D.C. into 4 groupings</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> States won by either party by:</li>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> 20 points or more - 135 electoral votes (includes New
York's 31 electoral votes)</li>
      <br>
      <li> 15-19 points - 51 electoral votes</li>
      <br>
      <li> 10-14 points - 139 electoral votes</li>
      <br>
      <li> 0-9 points - 213 electoral votes</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Keep in mind that to win a State does not require a majority of the
votes or even a near majority. Acquiring the electoral votes for a
given state (other than Maine and Nebraska) only requires that a
candidate get 1 more vote than any other candidate.&nbsp; A
candidate getting 34% of the vote, wins if no other candidate reaches
that number. <br>
<br>
It seems all but impossible for an Independent candidate to win in a
State that was won by the Democratic or Republican Presidential
candidates by 20 points or more.&nbsp; [135 votes] <br>
<br>
It seems very unlikely that an Independent candidate would come through
in States that were won by one Democratic or Republican Presidential
candidate or another by 15-19 points.&nbsp; [51 votes] <br>
<br>
That leaves 352 electoral votes in States in which the Democratic or
Republican Presidential candidates won by an average of 14% points or
less.&nbsp; It is from this group of States that an Independent
candidate must find the 270 votes he/she needs to be elected.&nbsp;
[Of that 352 votes, 139 votes are in States which were won by 10-14
points by one Party or the other.] <br>
<br>
While it is the case that the minimum number of States required to win
the election in the electoral college is 11 (California, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas), 3 of those States are probably off the
table. For details about each State and the 4 groupings see <a

major public survey was 12/11/06, when the LATimes/Bloomberg poll had
his approval at 40% and
his disapproval at 56%. In the most recent LATimes/Bloomberg
survey, taken in early June, his approval
rating was 34%. <br>
<br>
In 6 surveys taken between July 7th and July 18th, the President had an
average approval rating of 32% and a disapproval rating of
63%. [Real Clear Politics] <br>

Compared to the low points of other 2-term Presidents in the last 50
years, at this point in their Administrations, Bush continues to reside
in the cellar. <br>

In the 2nd week of June, the NBC/WSJ found that only 32% of Americans
felt even somewhat favorable toward the President. More
recently, in a mid-July
Gallup survey, 37% gave the President a favorable nod. <br>
<br>
There has been little or no improvement in the ratings of his job
performance on specific issues, such as Iraq, immigration, the economy,
and the campaign against
terrorism. <br>
<br>
64% of Americans believed that the President should not veto the stem
cell research bill, but he did anyway. [Gallup 6/07] <br>
<br>
To date, Bush has only issued 3 vetoes. This is far fewer
than any modern President, but he still has 18 months to go. <br>

<h2>The Vice President</h2>
Vice President Cheney marches to his own drummer. He clearly
takes positions and speaks out with absolutely no concern about how the
media, most of the public, or
even the Congress may react. Could it have anything to do with the fact
that he is the only Vice
President, at least going back to 1952, who did not have the potential
for or any expectation that he
might run for President in his own right? <br>
<br>
Only 30% approve of the job that Cheney is doing, and the same number
have a favorable opinion of him. These are both low points
for Cheney. At his
high point, in early 2002, 68% approved of the job he was doing, and
67% felt favorably toward him. [Gallup 1/02,
7/07]

Similarly, an AP-Ipsos survey in the 2nd week of July found 69% saying

While the immigration debate in Washington seems to have generated a
lot of public interest - 60% are following it at least somewhat closely
- it has not generated more
interest than other news events tracked by Gallup over the last
decade.&nbsp; There is also little
difference in the attention being paid based on the political Party
preference of the respondent. <br>
<br>
25% of Americans say that dealing with the illegal immigrants already
in the country should be the highest priority,&nbsp; while 20% say
the priority should be
cutting off the flow of new illegal immigrants.&nbsp; 53% say that
both matters should be treated equally. <br>

There is also a slight bias toward passing new laws (50%) over
enforcing current laws more strictly (46%). <br>
