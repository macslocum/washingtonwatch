<h2>Wisdom from Saul Turteltaub</h2>
Old is when you can't remember your wife's married name. Really old is
when you can't remember where you parked your car and you're still in
it. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
"Agreement on politics" is least important on a list of 9 items
associated with successful marriages. Only 12% think it is important. <br>
<br>
Topping the list is "faithfulness," which 93% say is
important.&nbsp; Moving up on the list, with the largest jump since
1990, is "sharing household chores," which now ranks 3rd, with 62%
listing it.&nbsp; It has jumped 15 points since 1990.&nbsp;

<br>
A large majority of Americans think that people spend too much money on
their weddings.&nbsp; And most of them don't know the half of
it.&nbsp; When asked how much the average American wedding costs,
the mean answer was $13,609.&nbsp; In fact, the average wedding
costs $27,490. <br>
<br>
And how much should you be spending on a wedding gift for a friend or
relative?&nbsp; The average of the responses was $110, with men
tending to be about 1.6 times more generous than women.&nbsp;
[Gallup 5/07; "Wedding Report," an industry publication] <br>

<h2>One Hundred Years Ago</h2>
Most women washed their hair only once a month, and used
borax or egg yolks for shampoo. <br>
<br>
The five leading causes of death in the U.S. were: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Pneumonia and influenza </li>
  <li>Tuberculosis </li>
  <li>Diarrhea </li>
  <li>Heart disease </li>
  <li>Stroke </li>
</ul>
The average U.S. worker made between $200 and $400 per
year.&nbsp; A competent accountant could expect to earn $2,000 per
year; a dentist $2,500 per year; a
veterinarian between $1,500 and $4,000 per year; and a mechanical
engineer about $5,000 per year. <br>
<br>
Marijuana, heroin, and morphine were all available, over the
counter, at the local corner drugstore! <br>
<br>
Crossword puzzles, canned beer, and iced tea hadn't been
invented yet. <br>
<br>
Only 6% of all Americans had graduated from high school. <br>
