</div>The owners of Rock Creek describe their offering as "conscious cuisine." 
<p>
There were 7 of us in your editor's first visit to this restaurant: Mike M, Sherry, Heidi, Sarabeth, Sam, Carol, and me. 
<p>
The main dining room seats about 75 people at tables ranging from 2s to 7s.  There is also a separate room near the front of the restaurant that houses a free-standing bar and several small tables. 
<p>
One thing sets this restaurant aside from every other restaurant reviewed in WW over the years.  On the individual menus distributed at the restaurant, and on the website, there are nutrition facts for each of the dishes served at the restaurant.  More about that a little later. 
<p>
1st course: 
<ul>
<li> Carol - Yellow Tomato Gazpacho; 
<p>
<li> Heidi - Curried Lobster Bisque with fresh fava beans, coconut milk, cilantro; 
<p>
<li> Sherry and Mike M - Baby Spinach Salad with strawberries, Maytag blue cheese, sweet onion vinaigrette; 
<p>
<li> Sam and Mike - Mediterranean Sample Plate with tabouleh, garlic eggplant puree, cucumber salad, rape leaves, olives, flat bread. 
<p>
<li> Sarabeth did not have a 1st course. 
</ul>
<p>
Entree: 
<ul>
<li> Sherry - Grilled Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with eggplant ratatouille, wilted arugala, Chanterelle Madeira sauce;

<p>
<li> Sam - Grilled All-Natural Chicken Breast with lemon-pepper spaetzle, baby french beans, carrots, chicken jus;  
<p>
<li> Mike - Jumbo Lump Crabcakes with celeriac-apple slaw, lemon-caper aioli; 
<p>
<li> Carol and Sarabeth - 5oz Grilled Filet Mignon with roasted sunchokes, jumbo asparagus, thyme jus; (another nice feature of the menu is that the filet comes in 5oz and 8oz sizes). 
</ul>
<p>
Dessert:  
<ul>
<li> Carol - Raspberries with Honey Yogurt; 
<p>
<li> Sherry and Heidi - Rock Creek Chocolate Cake with Light Whipped Cream; 
<p>

</ul>
<p>

<p>
<li> Sherry - 658 calories/51% fat; 
<p>
<li> Heidi - 923 calories/37% fat; 
<p>
<li> Sarabeth - 428 calories/36% fat; 
<p>

</ul>
The service was excellent and the various courses came in a timely fashion even though the restaurant was nearly full. 
<p>
There is a 3-course tasting menu several nights a week, but you can order individual items from that menu. 
<p>
The men's room is simple, clean and functional.  As you enter there is a white ceramic washbasin on the right.  Next is a white ceramic urinal, separated from the washbasin by a partial brown metal, wall-hanging divider.  Next in line is a very large commode area, fully accessible and separated from the rest of the room by a partial brown metal wall and door, open at top and bottom.  There is also a column of small metal lockers within the commode area. 
<p>
The floor is covered with medium-sized white tiles.  There are smaller tan tiles covering the walls from the floor to a height of 3.5 feet.  The rest of the walls and the ceiling are painted brown. 
<p>
Heidi reports that the women's room is very nice. 
<p>
There is valet parking (but not during July and August). Reservations are recommended. 
<p>
The owners of this restaurant are opening a second restaurant on the theater level of The Mazza Gallerie on upper Wisconsin Avenue.  It is scheduled to open around July 15th.
