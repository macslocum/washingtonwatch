<p></p>
There has been little change in the last couple of months in Americans'
pessimism about how things are going in this country. <br>
<br>
Mid-July surveys by Gallup and Newsweek found dissatisfaction running
71% and 68% respectively, with 27% in both surveys saying they are
satisfied. <br>
<br>
Similarly, an AP-Ipsos survey in the 2nd week of July found 69% saying
the country is on the wrong track, essentially the same number as found
by the NBC/WSJ survey
a month earlier that reported 68% saying we are on the wrong track. <br>
<br>
And, in a special survey of 17-19 year olds taken by CBS/NYT in
mid-June, 70% said the country is off on the wrong track, while 26%
said it is going in the right
direction. <br>
<br>
87% of African-Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going
in the country.&nbsp; This compares with 68% of Hispanics and
non-Hispanic whites who share that
view.&nbsp; [Gallup 6/07] <br>

There seems to be a slight up-tick in Americans' attitudes toward the
economy.&nbsp; However, they are less optimistic than they were in
January of this year.&nbsp;
Gallup combines data on how folks rate current economic conditions with
whether they think the economy is getting
better or worse: <br>

Here are the top priorities for the President and Congress that
Americans identified in June.&nbsp; They are compared to the
selection of priorities in April.&nbsp; Note
the movement of immigration, probably driven in part by the immigration
debate and the public responses during that
debate.&nbsp; [Gallup April, June 2007] <br>

While the immigration debate in Washington seems to have generated a
lot of public interest - 60% are following it at least somewhat closely
- it has not generated more
interest than other news events tracked by Gallup over the last
decade.&nbsp; There is also little
difference in the attention being paid based on the political Party
preference of the respondent. <br>
<br>
25% of Americans say that dealing with the illegal immigrants already
in the country should be the highest priority,&nbsp; while 20% say
the priority should be
cutting off the flow of new illegal immigrants.&nbsp; 53% say that
both matters should be treated equally. <br>
<br>
There is also a slight bias toward passing new laws (50%) over
enforcing current laws more strictly (46%). <br>

The number of Americans reporting that they had difficulty paying for
healthcare costs over the last year has slightly more than doubled in
the last 30 years. <br>
<br>
32% report having trouble paying for healthcare in the last year, as
compared to 15% in 1976. Hispanics (45%) and blacks (43%) report
significantly more troubles in
this area than whites (25%). <br>

Workers' contributions toward family healthcare reached $2,973 in 2006,
an increase of 84% since 2000.&nbsp; [Gallup June, 2007; Kaiser

By 52% to 28%, Americans believe that global terrorism is a greater
long-term threat than "the effects of climate change and global
warming."&nbsp; [Fox News poll
6/6/07] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
41% are highly concerned about the issue of global warming. This is an
increase of 15 points since 2003, but it simply brings concern back to
where it was in
2000.&nbsp; But the level of concern has a political
overtone.&nbsp; 85% of Democrats and leaners worry a "great deal"
about global warming, but only 46% of Republicans and leaners share
that sentiment.&nbsp; The number of
people who feel they understand the issue of global warming very well
or fairly well, has reached an all-time high
of 76%.&nbsp; [Gallup 3/07 and earlier] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
<br>
Americans believe that protection of the environment (58%) is more
important than increasing production of energy supplies (34%), and they
are more likely to prefer
conservation of current energy supplies (64%) than increasing
production (26%).&nbsp; [Gallup
3/07]&nbsp; Whether their choices are realistic remains to be seen.

65% of Democrats believe that restrictions on stem cell research using
Federal funds should be eased.&nbsp; This is a sentiment that is
shared by only 45% of
Republicans.&nbsp; Independents fall in the middle, at
61%.&nbsp; [Gallup 6/07] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br>

Overall, 56% of us say that religion is very important in our
lives.&nbsp; This includes 66% of Republicans, 57% of

What is your view of the Bible?&nbsp; 47% of us believe it is the
"inspired word of God."&nbsp; 31% of us believe it is the "actual
word of God to be taken literally."&nbsp; (25 years ago, 38% held
this view.)&nbsp; 19% believe the Bible is a group of "ancient
fables, history and legends recorded by man." <br>
<br>
The more formal education that a person acquires, the more likely
he/she is to see the Bible as "inspired by God," and less likely to see
it as "the word of God."&nbsp; [Gallup average of polls in May of

The other day, WW leaned from the 6 people under 30 working in the
office, none of whom live together, that none of them have&nbsp;
landline telephones in their apartments. <br>
<br>
It turns out that <br>
<ul>
  <li>25% of those in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 24 do
not have landlines. </li>
  <li>29% of 25-29 year olds are cellphone-only users. </li>
  <li>Males are slightly more likely than females to only have
cell-phones.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

Not only are young people eschewing landlines, they are also shying
away from newspapers.&nbsp; Only 9% of teenagers read a newspaper
every day.&nbsp; This compares to a slightly larger percentage of
18-30 year olds (16%), and 35% of those over 30 years of age.&nbsp;

Over the last 5 years, the number of us who say that the state of moral
values in this country is "poor" has reached a high of 44%, with 82% of
Americans thinking moral values are getting worse. [Gallup May 2007] <br>

The number of people who think doctor-assisted suicide is morally
acceptable is the same today as it was in 2001.&nbsp; 49% find it
acceptable, while 44% find it to be morally wrong. <br>
<br>
However, 56% of Americans believe that a doctor should be allowed to
help a patient commit suicide, if the patient requests it, and 71%
believe that a doctor should be allowed to painlessly end the life of a
person with an incurable disease, if the patient and his/her family
request it.&nbsp; [Gallup May 2007] <br>

We are getting older.&nbsp; As of 2006, the median age of people
living in the United States is 36.4 years, up from 35.3 years in
2000.&nbsp; The "oldest" state is Maine, with
a median age of 41.3 years, and the "youngest" state is California at
34.4 years. <br>
<br>
Between 2000 and 2006 the population of the United States grew by
6.4%.&nbsp; During that same period the number of Hispanics grew by
25.5%. <br>
<br>
Nevada, with a growth in population of 25%, had the largest increase in
the period.&nbsp; In second place was Arizona, with a growth rate
of 20%.&nbsp; The States which lost
the greatest percentage of their population were Louisiana, at a -4%,
and North Dakota, which lost 1% of its
population.&nbsp; [Census Bureau estimates] <br>

<br>
Americans now believe that significant fatness - obesity - is as
harmful to a person's health as smoking.&nbsp; 83% view obesity as
"very harmful" and 79% have the
same view about smoking. <br>
<br>
28% say that obesity has been a cause of serious health problems in
their family.&nbsp; 74% are sympathetic to those who suffer from
severe fatness, as compared to 58%
who have that view toward smokers.&nbsp; By some margin, men (25%)
tend to be less
sympathetic than women (17%) toward those who struggle with obesity. <br>

<h2>17-29 year olds: How they think about various issues</h2>
NYT/CBS/MTV joined together for a special survey of 17-29 year olds in
mid-June 2007.&nbsp; Here are some of their beliefs about the role
of government: <br>
<ul>
  <li>62% think it is very important that government policies
promote job training and job opportunitie for younger workers </li>
  <br>
  <li>60% say it is very important for the government to have
policies that provide insurance coverage to folks that do not have it. </li>
  <br>
  <li>37% believe that abortion should be generally available;
38%
say available, but under strict limits; and 24% say it should not be
permitted.&nbsp; This is almost identical to the positions taken by
all adults. </li>
  <br>
  <li>55% think the healthcare system in the country requires
fundamental changes </li>
  <br>
  <li>62% favor a government-administered, single-payer system </li>
</ul>
