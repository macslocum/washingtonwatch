<h1>PS7</h1>
777 I Street NW<br>
Washington, D.C.<br> 
202-742-8550 <br>
<a href="http://www.PS7restaurant.com">PS7restaurant.com</a>
</div>The restaurant opened in September 2006.  The PS is from the name of the chef/owner Peter Smith and the 7 comes from the 777 address. 
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, there is bar area to the right.  There are 10 high stools at the bar, and a seating area, with a padded high backbench, along one wall, and a variety of comfortable chairs that in total seems to accommodate about two dozen people. 
<br><br>
The dining area is to the left.  First, there is a dining room filled with tables of 4 and tables of 2 that could be moved around to create larger tables.  The room holds about 40 as configured. Outside the dining room is another dining area that runs the length of what is a fairly narrow room.  The dining area is on two levels, running the length of the area. On the raised area there is a row of 4s and deuces.  On the floor, there is a another row of 4s, and across the narrow area of couple of deuces.  The area seems to seat about 32. At the end of this area there is a semi-private dining area.  There is a curtain that is pulled over the large opening to the area. The evening we were there it had one large table that could seat 10 around a large square.  But it appeared that it could also be broken up into four 4s. 
<br><br>
The menu is somewhat unusual. There are 5 columns of items with a price at the top of each column, being the cost of each of the items.  The columns ranged from $10 to $23.  There is a sixth column that is a 5-course tasting menu, priced at $77 and $107 with wines. The foods in each column seem to grow in size of portion from the lowest priced to the highest priced.  It appears that the $10, $13 and $15 columns are intended to be appetizers, but for sure the items in the $15 column work well as small entrees. 
<br><br>
I started with Sarah's Salad, composed of Bosc pears, Maytag blue cheese, dried cherries, spiced walnuts, pickled pearl onions, mini croutons, and Pear Nectar Dressing. I then selected as my "entree" two items. From the $13 column I chose Speck Ham Wrapped Monkfish, with spice roasted butternut squash and Chanterelle Mushroom Broth.  The other selection from the $15 column was Pan Roast Duck Breast, with Mission figs, raised parsnips and Roasted pearl onions with Rosemary Jus. For certain the latter dish was ample as a main course. The other 8 people in our group selected a variety of items, including Butter Nut Squash Soup, Portobella Mushroom Carpaccio, Sarah's Salad, Pan Roasted Rockfish, Pan Seared Sea Scallops, and Red Wine Braised Beef Shortribs. 
<br><br>
No one in our group had dessert, but there are some appropriately decadent selections. 
<br><br>
The men's room is all black, except for the white wash basins, urinals, commode, and large charcoal gray tiles covering the floor.  There are black mid-size tiles from floor to ceiling, covering the entire back wall.  The lighting is subdued. As you enter the room you can't help but notice to your left, at about the 6+ foot level, two gold fish bowls embedded in the wall.  There are several goldfish swimming in each one.  There is an opening at the top of the bowl that allows air into the bowl. There are two urinals straight ahead, separated by a partial wall between them, that is about 3 feet high.  The commode is situated next to the urinals, but it is enclosed in floor-to-ceiling walls and a door. Across from the commode area is a black marble counter with two wash basis and a large round mirror. 
<br><br>
There is valet parking.

</div>When you arrive at 12th and K and don't immediately see the restaurant, don't give up.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the Four Points Hotel.
<br><br>
Chris and I arrived for lunch, and saw a large sign in a main floor window that would make you believe that the restaurant is behind that window.  No such luck.  The only way to the restaurant is through the hotel lobby, but even when you enter the lobby, the location of the restaurant is still a mystery. We never did see a sign directing us to the restaurant.  Chris asked a person walking by and they directed us upstairs. We took the elevator to the 2nd floor. Even when we got off the elevator, it was a challenge to find the restaurant.  Turn right after you get off the elevator, or left, if you decide to use the stairs. As you enter there is, directly ahead, a walled-off area, including a long bar and a good number of tables. 
<br><br>
There are about 70 seats - 2s & 4s - with a banquette running along the far wall of the dining room. I tried to get a noon reservation, but could not get a reservation before 12:30 p.m. It was a little hard to understand that limitation since there were a number of tables available when we arrived, and it does not seem likely that at that hour they had been vacated by a first round of diners. It seemed particularly noisy as the dining room filled up. 
<br><br>
Service was timely, but I don't think we saw a single smile on a captain, serving person, or bus person during our entire visit. There are 8 first courses, 8 second courses, and 10 desserts.  The prices are moderate. 
<br><br>
Chris had the potato leek soup, which was just okay, followed by duck confit with savoy cabbage. I had the warm goat cheese in crispy potato - which was quite good.  The cheese was firm and warm, and the fine string potatoes were very crispy.  
<br><br>
For my second course, I chose crispy striped bass with sherry vinegar sauce. We shared pistachio bread pudding with a dollop of ice cream. The portion sizes were about right for lunch.  
<br><br>
The restaurant does not have its own bathroom.  Rather you are directed to the hotel bathroom, which is like a thousand other standard hotel bathrooms ... not worth writing about.  Finding it is also a challenge.

<h1>Chez Panisse</h1>
1517 Shattuck Avenue<br>
Berkeley, California 94709 <br>
510-548-5525 <br>
<a href="http://www.chezpanisse.com">www.chezpanisse.com</a>
</div>There are really two restaurants.  On the main floor, there is a dining room that on any given day serves only a single meal for dinner.  If that meal is not to your liking there are no alternatives. The menus for a whole week are available.  
<br><br>
On the night we did not eat there the menu was grilled asparagus with morel cream, Dungeness crab bisque with aioli and crouton, whole roasted Sonoma County Liberty duck with green and black olives, potatoes with pancetta, and Chino Ranch flat black cabbage, and Page mandarin, grapefruit and Meyer lemon sherbet coupe. 
<br><br>
Carol and I had dinner with Florence and Peter in the Café on the 2nd floor. The Café is relatively narrow and quite long.  As you come off the stairs, dead ahead there is an area of small round tables and chairs on which folks can wait for their party to fill out or until their table is ready.  It is the restaurant's policy to not seat anyone until the whole party has assembled. 
<br><br>
To the right, there is a table across from the seating area that seems able to seat up to 8 people.  It was set for 4, but not used the night we were there. Including that section for 4, there is seating for about 45 people in 2s, 3s, and 4s. One section of this part of the Café is raised about 4 feet above the rest of the restaurant, and seats about 10. 
<br><br>
The tables are pretty close together, and covered with white cloths and white paper. To the left, at the top of the stairs, is a serving bar and the open kitchen. There are also two additional seating areas. Across from the kitchen are 4 booths, each of which seats up to 5 people.  At the end of the kitchen, there is a room that seats another 20 people in 2s and 4s. 
<br><br>
Peter and Carol started with Baked Sonoma goat cheese with Viki's lettuces. Florence and Mike selected the red beet soup with creme fraiche.  We also ordered for the table Monterey Bay sardine toasts with frisee and cardoon salad, and a plate of olives. 
<br><br>
As her second course, Carol selected hand-cut egg noodles with fava beans, ramps and pecorino; Florence ordered Northern halibut with grilled asparagus, anise hyssop, and shoestring potatoes.  Peter and Mike had grilled Hoffman Farm chicken breast, with potato-sorrel gratin and tapenade.  Peter also ordered an additional plate of the shoestrings, which were quite good. 
<br><br>
For dessert we shared an order of Meyer lemon sorbet with Moscato d'Asti and langues de chat, and a bowl of Jim Churchill's Pixie tangerines and Fly Disc Ranch Barhi dates. 
<br><br>
While our principal waiter was a little officious, the service was generally good. 
<br><br>
The men's room is small, dingy, and slightly musty.  As you enter, there is a 5 small dark stone counter just to the left with a gold colored metal washbasin. Next to the counter is a floor-to- ceiling solid wall that juts out about 2.5-3 feet.  On the other side of the wall is a white ceramic commode.  Across from the commode, in the relatively small room, is a white ceramic urinal. The floor is covered with large dark tiles, and the walls are painted a tannish yellow wall. Overall this room is not special. 
<br><br>
Reservations are essential.

</div>The restaurant is long from front to back; in fact, a block long.  There is a bar along the wall from the front to about a third of the way back.  There is also a second bar that starts about 25 feet later, along the same wall that fronts on the open kitchen.  It is clear that folks eat at the 2nd bar, that's not clear about the first.  The two bars seat about 25 people. 
<br><br>
The dining room runs the length of the restaurant, and seats about 160.  There is a small private dining room that seats 10- 12 people. 
<br><br>
As is often the case when having a meal with Peter, before dinner was served, in responding to Peter's questions, our server had shared with us an abbreviated version of her life story.  The exchange with our server continued throughout the meal. The service was excellent. 
<br><br>
Peter started with Glazed Sweetbreads with Roman Style Artichokes, Bacon Marmalade, Baby Cabbage, and Frisee.  I opted for Rabbit, Wild Mushroom & Rapini Ravioli, with Truffled Pecorino, Hazelnut Pesto, and Braising Jus. 
<br><br>
Moving on, Peter selected Wood Over Roasted Angus Filet Mignon, Pan Roasted Yukon Gold Potatoes and Mushrooms, French Beans with Applewood Bacon and Crispy Shallots, Mushroom Fritters, Tomato Aioli & Red Wine Beef Jus. I chose the Wild Caught & Pan Roasted California White Sea Bass, with Spring Pea Risotto, Dungeness Crab Thighs, Snap Peas, and Miners Lettuce. 
<br><br>
The dessert options were just too good to pass up.  Peter savored the Chocolate Truffle Cake with Fleur de Sei Chocolate Caramel, Butter Pecan Ice Cream, and Whiskey Chocolate Ice Cream. Because I thought I should have fruit for dessert, I ordered Strawberry Rhubarb Ice Box Cake, with layers of Pixie Tangerine & Chai Cheesecake, Warm Rhubarb, and Fresh Strawberries. 
<br><br>
One other thing that I particularly liked was the fact that when I ordered iced tea, I received a glass of iced tea and a carafe of same that was left on the table.  A glass with additional ice showed up about half way through the meal. Peter and I agreed that this was an excellent meal. 
<br><br>
The men's room is large and "L" shaped and its own way quite special. As you enter, a black marble counter with two metal washbasins is on the right, under a very large framed mirror. As you turn the corner at the heel of the "L," you first come upon two white ceramic urinals with a gray marble divider between them.  To their left are two commode stalls, with grey marble walls that are open at top and bottom.  Each has a heavy wooden door. The walls are covered, to about the 4 foot level, with a grey/green raised relief. The walls above are painted. The floor is covered with large off-white tiles, except for a row of half-sized black tiles at the wall, running around the room. As you start to leave the commode area, you note that, among the pictures on the wall, are several old-style female nudes. Then, as you stand at the counter to wash your hands, you can not help but notice in the mirror the large frame with dozens of photos old and new female nudes on the wall behind you.  Of the many restrooms that WW has reviewed this is a first. We asked our female server whether they were pictures of male nudes in the woman's restroom.  She assured us there were not. 
<br><br>
There is valet parking and reservations are suggested.

<br><br>
Being in any San Francisco restaurant with Stan and Julia is always a treat. (Stan thinks it is because of him; fact is, that it is because of Julia.) 
<br><br>
There are only about 45 seats in the main restaurant, mainly tables of 2 and 4, but there is table in a front window alcove that seats up to six. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is very nicely appointed.  It is not large, and while the tables are relatively close together, it does not seem crowded.  There is a shoulder-high barrier of wood, topped by glass, that separates the entry area from the tables. Glass chandeliers and sconces contributes to the atmosphere. There is a chef's table (seats 10) located in what, at first glance, appears to be an unfinished basement.  
<br><br>
The table is located next to the bakery and the vegetable prep station.  To get to the table  you walk through a door in the back of the restaurant, past the kitchen, and down a steep flight of stairs. 
<br><br>
The food and the preparation are superb.  Even the bread tray is special.  The bread sticks are quite good, but the real treat is the little round rolls that almost taste like cake. 
<br><br>
The meal began with an Aamuse bouche of a fish-based mousse on a toasted crouton with sauce. For a first course, Stan chose Fairview Gardens white asparagus, with Maine lobster, English peas, & chervil. Stanley managed to convince the server to let him have this dish, which was actually part of the Tasting menu.  Julia selected buttered lettuce, with Georgia white shrimp, celery hearts and herbs.  Carol opted for a smoked trout salad with Mariquita Farm beets & horseradish.  I chose crispy sardines with raw purple asparagus salad and mint. 
<br><br>
As a second course, Stan had pappardelle, with pork sausage & red mustard greens.  Carol picked fettuccine verde, with green asparagus with white asparagus cream ,and I chose agnologtti dal plin, a traditional Piedmontese-filled pasta.
<br><br>
For the 3rd course, Stan had the Thai snapper, with fennel, cauliflower and orange-saffron fumetto.  Carol chose John Dory, with Bloomsdale spinach & porcini mushrooms.  I also chose a fish, Eastern skate with black trumpet mushroom puree, young onions, and  asparagus.  Julia had the Fettuccine verde. 
<br><br>
Dessert was beyond our capacity, but there was an extensive dessert menu with 6 prepared desserts and a choice of 11 cheeses. 
<br><br>
There is also a Tasting menu, which is only prepared for an entire table.  It includes 6 courses, with suggested wines for each course.  This costs $140 (food alone is $85), plus $10 if you want a cheese supplement.  While we did not try this menu, there is no doubt in my mind that it would be worth the cost in both dollars and calories. 
<br><br>
The service is unparalleled.  There are at least 10-12 serving people in the main dining room, in addition to several folks who greet and seat guests.  While there is a principal server assigned to each table, each course is served to each person at the table all but simultaneously, with each server being responsible for serving no more than two people.  For example, when each course was served to a table of six, it was delivered by 3 servers. 
<br><br>
The sommelier used to be at another fine San Francisco restaurant, Gary Danko. Quince is owned by Michael and Lindsay Tusk.  Michael is the chef, while Lindsay attends to the dining room. Interestingly, one of places at which Michael trained was Chez Panisse, which is also reviewed in this issue. 
<br><br>
The unisex restroom is the narrowest I have ever encountered.  It can't be more than 4 feet wide and about twice as long . Yet, even with its diminutive size, it is as elegant as the restaurant of which it is a part. Immediately to the left as you enter is a narrow, mottled orange/tan and white marble counter that juts out in a half circle to accommodate the small white ceramic washbasin.  There is a long silver tray at the end that holds fluffy white rolled towels. At the end of this narrow room is a white ceramic commode. The floor is covered with large tan tiles. The walls are painted light tan. 
<br><br>
There is valet parking and reservations are a must. [Note: Subsequent to our visit, Hilary and Jane went there for dinner at your editor's suggestion.  They were equally delighted.]

                                 During 2006, the average Congressional job approval rating in the NBC/WSJ surveys was 24% approval and 63% disapproval. In its final survey before the election, job disapproval of the Congress reached 75%. 
<br><br>
For the 1st 3.5 months under the new Democratic control of the Congress there has been some improvement, but the Congress still has a long way to go. Its job approval stands at 31% and disapproval at 52% in the survey taken the 4th week in April.
<br><br>
In that same survey, 60% of respondents said that the Democrats had so far not brought much change either way, while 20% said they had brought the right kind of change, and 15% the wrong kind of change. 
<br><br>
Interestingly, there has been a substantial drop in the number saying Democrats had brought the right kind of change. In the NBC/WSJ January survey, shortly after the Democrats had taken charge, 42% said they had brought the right kind of change. 
<br><br>
In the most recent Gallup Poll (May 10-13) only 29% approve of the job that Congress is doing. 
<br><br>
An average of a half dozen recent surveys shows that the Democrats have a lead of 52% to 41% in a generic Congressional vote.

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

The Democrats control the Senate by a slim 51-49 margin. Their 5-person majority includes two Senators who describe themselves as Independents. 
<br><br>
One of the them, Bernie Saunders of Vermont, is often described as a socialist. But he votes with the Democrats on almost every issue, so for all practical purposes he is a Democrat. 
<br><br>
The second Independent is Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Lieberman was the incumbent Democratic Senator from that State, who ran as an Independent in 2006, when the Democratic Party denied him its nomination. His dispute with the Party centered almost exclusively on his support for the President on the Iraq war. Republicans generally supported Lieberman in the election, and that, added to a core group of Democrats, resulted in his victory. Other than on organization of the body, Lieberman's vote with the Democratic caucus is less reliable. 
<br><br>
It is too early in the cycle to accurately assess the prospects for the Democrats to increase their margin. At least at present, the prospects of the Republicans regaining control is marginal at best. 
<br><br>
One current Republican seat, Colorado, is rated as a tossup because the incumbent is not standing for re-election. The State has been leaning Democratic in recent elections. 
<br><br>
One incumbent Democrat, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, is considered vulnerable, given the continuing political unrest in that State following the devastating hurricanes. It is argued that a large number of her voters from New Orleans are now displaced, including some who have relocated to other States. The big question is whether folks who have lost their homes and community will bother to participate in the election. 
<br><br>
Other Senate seats that might come into serious contention, "if," are:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Arkansas - if Republican Mike Huckebee drops out of the Presidential races and decides to take on Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor.</li>
<br>
<li> South Dakota - if incumbent Democrat Tom Johnson ends up not running for re-election.</li>
<br>
<li> Virginia - if incumbent Republican John Warner decides not to seek reelection.</li> 
<br>
<li> New Mexico - if incumbent Republican Pete Dominici decides not to run or if he is found to have violated Senate ethics rules around the replacement of the U.S. attorney in that State.</li> 
</ul>
<br>
The U.S. Senate 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Democrats 49</li>
<li> Republicans 49 </li>
<li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem) </li>
</ul>

Here is how the 33 Senate elections (12 Democratic incumbents, 21 Republican incumbents) look to me at this time (underlining reflects retirement). (D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP incumbent in office, I=Ind. incumbent in office)

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>

In the House the Democrats have a 233 to 202 margin, with 1 Democratic seat and 1 Republican seat currently vacant. It is too early to make a thorough assessment of what might happen in the 2008 election. However, the early view is that the Democrats could pick up additional seats. If that does occur, the principal driver will be that voters want to 
punish Republicans because of the Administration's policy on the war. 
<br><br>
The Cook Political Report show 2 open Democratic seats in 2008 and 8 potentially open seats. One the Republican side, there is 1 open seat and 12 potentially open seats.

                                 On January 31st, your editor appeared on the Paula Zahn show in a segment that addressed the question of whether a fat person could be elected President of the United States. 
<br><br>
I took the position that a really fat person could not be elected, given the general public attitude toward fat people. However, that was not always the case.
<br><br>
There were two pretty fat Presidents, Grover Cleveland, who was first elected in 1884, and William Taft, who was elected in 1908. 
<br><br>
Both men were subject to a variety of unkind editorial comments. 
<br><br>
When Cleveland arrived in Washington he was described as a “huge, bejowled man, a walrus in wingtips, resembling Boss Tweed carrying 280 pounds on a small, beleaguered frame.” “Porcine” is another word that was used when describing him, while his suits were said to be “like Tarpaulins” and straining at the buttons. Toward the end of his second term 
he was called “The Fat Knight.” 
<br><br>
William Taft, who was likely our heaviest President, was pictured in one cartoon as setting foot in Cuba and sinking one side of the island; in another he was characterized as a kewpie doll. Nathan Miller, in his book America's Ten Worst Presidents, refers to Taft as weighing somewhere between 300 and 350 pounds. Whether or not that fact had anything 
to do with how well he did or didn't do as President is a matter of conjecture. 
<br><br>
WW decided to see how our Presidents have done when it comes to their size and weight. After all, we expect them to lead us in a variety of ways, why not when it comes to weight? WW was able to locate published information for only 23 of the 44 Presidents. 
<br><br>
To make a "reasonable" comparison among Presidents, WW used the Body Mass Index (BMI), a standard that takes into account height and weight. The current BMI standard has been adopted by an expert panel appointed by the National Institutes of Health as the new standard for predicting the risks associated with overweight.

The smallest President was James Madison, who was reported to stand about 5'4" in height and weighed in at 100 pounds (BMI 17.8). The "heavy weight" was William Taft, who entered office at 6'0" and 330 pounds (BMI 44.65). 
<br><br>
As you can see from the list that follows, most Presidents ( whose data WW could locate) had BMIs that were within or close to the so-called "healthy" weight - 20 - class (a BMI of less than 25). (By the way, all but two of them would have been in that class before the standard was changed in 1998. But that is another story.)

The current President Bush's classification on the BMI scale provides an important example of why all general population standards should be used as guidelines, but not definitive markers. The President is, in fact, in excellent physical condition, even though he gained 5 pounds during the last year. 
<br><br>
In the interest of full disclosure, I had a BMI of 47.63 at my highest, and even today it is 36. If you want to find your own BMI, there are several websites that will do the calculation for you. <a href="http://www.NHLbisupport.com/bmi">www.NHLbisupport.com/bmi</a> is one.

                                 2008 marks the 55th quadrennial election for President and Vice President of the United States. Americans will elect the 44th President and 47th Vice President. This will be the 1st election since 1928 when there is no incumbent President seeking re-election or a Vice-President seeking to ascend to the Presidency. 
<br><br>
3 of the 6 leading candidates for the office, 1 Republican and 2 Democrats, are members of the United States Senate. The last time a sitting Senator won the Presidency was in 1960. 
<br><br>
The record for House members is worse. It has been 127 years since a sitting Member of the House was elected to the Presidency - James Garfield, the 20th President. 

<h2>The Field</h2> 
The field is pretty robust, with 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats having entered the race. And the field may not yet be complete. On the Republican side there are at least 2 possible additional entries, and 1 on the Democratic side. Of this group of possibles, the most likely additional entrant is Fred Thompson, a former Senator from Tennessee, and  currently a prominent actor and commentator. 
<br><br>
It remains to be seen whether the Green Party will enter a real candidate, and many folks are pressing the Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, to run as an Independent.

Are there some aspects of the various Presidential candidates that could turn off some numbers of voters? Gallup inquired about this subject in two surveys this spring and here are the results:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 41% would not vote for a person 72 years old</li>
<br>
<li> 29% would not vote for someone has been married 3 times</li>
<br>
<li> 22% won't vote for a Mormon</li> 
<br>
<li> 11% won't vote for a woman</li> 
<br>
<li> 5% won't vote for an African-American</li>
</ul>
<br>
At least that is what folks tell the pollsters 
<br><br>
When asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of various current and potential candidates for President, here is how Americans responded in an USA Today / Gallup Poll in early May:

Many of these candidates have more room to grow, either because they have never been heard of or folks know of them, but are not yet ready to express an opinion about them. Here is the same list ranked on the basis of the greatest number of No opinion/Never Heard Of responses:

<h2>A Few Questions:</h2>

<ul>
<li> Will Obama be able to translate the outpouring of support that he has received in person and on the internet into an activated grass roots team?</li> 
<br>
<li> Will Romney be able to overcome concerns about his Mormon religious beliefs? </li> 
<br>
<li> Will Giuliani be able to hold onto core Republican support in the light of 3 marriages, an apparent estrangement from his children, his business dealings, his squirming about on abortion, and his positions on other social issues? </li> 
<br>
<li> Will Clinton find the voice to show the public her more personal side? </li> 
<br>
<li> Will McCain be able to overcome concerns about his age and loss of his maverick quality? </li> 
<br>
<li> Will Edwards be able to overcome the apparent inconsistencies of $400 hair cuts and working for a hedge fund that is into subprime loans? </li> 
<br>
<li> Will Gore, Fred Thompson, and Gingrich join the race? </li> 
</ul>

<h2>The Primaries</h2>

The biggest change this year is the front loading of the primary/caucus election process. 
<br><br>
In 2004, through the 1st Tuesday in February, 7 States had held their primaries and caucuses, and none of the States in that group were in the list of the 5 largest States by population. 
<br><br>
In 2008, through the 1st Tuesday in February, at least 29 States will have held their primaries and caucuses, including all 5 of the largest States by population. 
<br><br>
In her recent column in Politico, Elizabeth Wilner writes about the angst being expressed about the massing of early primaries. She wrote, "States with late primary dates have grown sick of being disenfranchised." And, "...the very understandable and healthy concept of voters wanting to play a bigger role than usual in the biggest race in history." 
She points out that, in 2004, John Kerry had clinched the nomination by the close of business by the 1st Tuesday in February. And, in 2000, when "six weeks separated Iowa and New Hampshire from the next round of Democratic contests," Gore had clinched the nomination before the polls opened for the 2nd round.
<br><br>
While folks will continue to complain about how bad the new calendar is, keep in mind that their opinions are not based on history or experience. 
<br><br>
Another important element of this super, super Tuesday, February 5th, is early voting. Of the States that will hold primaries on or before February 5th , 14 of them permit "No Excuse required, early voting." For example, votes may be cast in California beginning on January 7th . In addition, all of the voting in Oregon, one of the early States, is by mail. 
There is little doubt that we will know the nominees of the Democratic and Republican Parties by the end of February 5, 2008.

<h2>The Early Primary Returns</h2>

Before 2007 began, Hillary Clinton, in the Democratic primary, and John McCain, in the Republican primary, were the putative favorites for the nomination. 
<br><br>
4 months into the year, Barack Obama is proving to be a strong contender in the Democratic race, and John McCain is running a poor second to Rudy Giuliani in the Republican race. 
<br><br>
National polls in primary campaigns can be misleading because they do not take into account what is happening in particular States. However, they are an indicator. 
<br><br>
In the Democratic primary, over the 3-month period from mid-January to mid-April, Obama has moved up, while Clinton has been steady. Edwards has had some ups and downs, but, at the end of the 3-month period, he is slightly ahead of where he was in mid-January. 
<br><br>
In a hypothetical 2-way race between Clinton and Obama, both candidates are just about where they were at the beginning of the year.

In the Republican primary during the same period, Giuliani grew some and McCain declined. No other Republican candidate has more than single digit support. The wild card is whether former Senator Fred Thompson decides to get into the race. 
<br><br>
In a hypothetical 2-way race between Giuliani and McCain, Giuliani has grown and McCain slipped slightly.

<h2>The Money Primary</h2>

On the overall numbers, Senator Hillary Clinton was the winner of the 1st "election" of the money primary, which ended on March 31st . A close second was Senator Obama, followed by Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani. 
<br><br>
But the real winner, in the Democratic primary chase in particular, was Senator Obama. While Clinton raised $26,054,000, Obama was only a hair's breadth behind, with $25,709,000. John Edwards trailed, raising $14,000,000. "Everyone," with the possible exception of Obama, was surprised by the amount the Obama campaign raised.
<br><br>
Most notable is that Obama outraised Clinton by $5,600,000 in contributions that can be used in the primary. Nearly $7,000,00 of the total raised by Clinton can only be spent in the general election. 
<br><br>
In reaching these totals, the Obama campaign received contributions from 104,000 donors, about half of whom contributed through the internet. The Clinton campaign claimed about 60,000 supporters. 
<br><br>
While the amount that each candidate raised in the quarter is interesting, 1st the more important question is how much each candidate has available to spend at the beginning of the 2nd quarter. 
<br><br>
The Clinton and Obama campaigns spent equal amounts in the 1st quarter.  By that measure Obama should lead in cash-on-hand. However, Clinton ended up with $4,400,000 more cash-on-hand because she began the 2nd quarter with $22,400,000 net cash (cash minus debt). Obama had $18,100,000 at the beginning of the quarter, and Edwards started 
the 2nd quarter with $10,700,000 available. 
<br><br>
The reason for Clinton's cash advantage is simple. Clinton transferred $10,000,000 from her just-completed Senate campaign to her Presidential account. Other Democratic and Republican candidates have also engaged in such transfers. [See note #2 in the chart at the end of this section.] 
<br><br>
The Clinton campaign decided to actively raise primary and general election money at the same time from the outset, and sought contributions for both elections. Obama supporters could also opt to contribute to the primary and general, but the campaign did not push that alternative. 
<br><br>
Based on an Opinion rendered by the Federal Election Commission to the Obama campaign, a candidate for President may solicit funds for the general election and still retain the option of taking the Federal grant of roughly $85,000,000. 
<br><br>
After securing the nomination, a candidate may decide whether to go with private financing or take the general election grant. However, if he or she has spent any of the general election money, that option disappears. If a candidate opts for Federal financing in the general, all of the funds raised for the general must be returned to the contributors. 
<br><br>
It will be interesting to see how hard the Clinton campaign will push the general election contribution option now that she trails in the primary money derby. 
<br><br>
In the Republican money race, Romney raised $20,983,000, to capture 1st place, running nearly $5,000,000 ahead of Giuliani's $16,100,000. The big surprise of the Republican chase was the 3rd place finish of McCain, who raised only $13,680,000.
<br><br>
On the other hand, Romney spent $13,675,000, while Giuliani held his spending to $6,130,000. McCain sent $11,400,000 out the door. 
<br><br>
As they headed into the 2nd quarter, Giuliani had the greatest amount of net cash, with $11,861,000 (including $2,000,000 transferred from his aborted 2000 U.S. Senate campaign), followed by Romney, with $9,514,000, whose total includes a $2,350,000 personal loan that he made to his campaign. 
<br><br>
McCain was hurting, with only $3,368,000 on hand. He has subsequently revamped his fundraising operation. While the 2nd quarter fundraising/spending activity of all the campaigns is important, recovery is critical for McCain. As of this writing, the McCain campaign says it is meeting its fundraising goals for this quarter, and is working to get 
spending under control. 
<br><br>
To put 1st quarter fundraising in some kind of perspective, WW looked back at the successful 1984 Mondale primary campaign. [Your editor was Treasurer of that campaign.] During the entire 19-month primary campaign, the Mondale campaign's total spending was $25,000,000, the maximum amount allowed for a campaign that accepted primary matching funds. Of that total, about $17,000,000 was raised by the campaign, and the balance came from the U.S. Treasury in matching funds. 
<br><br>
The maximum allowable individual contribution was $1,000, as compared to the current $2,300. 
<br><br>
With the simple application of inflation, that $25,000,000 campaign would cost $50,000,000 today. Several of these campaigns could well raise more than amount in the 1st six months of the current campaign. 
<br><br>
[A detailed chart of primary fundraising follows. Please read the footnotes; they will explain why many of the numbers in this chart are different than those published in other media. WW believes that this is a more accurate reflection of fundraising and expenditure.]

Any question that may exist as to whether Presidential candidates are likely to suffer voter irritation by not taking public funding seems to be decided on the side of not taking Federal funds. 
<br><br>
56% think candidates for President should opt not to take public financing and spend whatever money they can raise on their own. [Gallup 4/07]

<h2>The General Election</h2>

18 months from now and $1 billion dollars in campaign-related expenses (from 1/1/07) Americans will cast their votes for President. 
<br><br>
To add an historical complication to the race for the Democrats, the last time that a Party won the Presidency in the next election after it took back the Congress in a mid-term election was 1920. 
<br><br>
By 50% to 35% Americans would like to see the Democrats gain the Presidency in the next election. But that margin does not translate into an automatic Democratic victory, at least based on current matchups between major Democratic and Republican candidates. [These early matchups don't mean much, but they make good fodder for conversation.]

The Gallup survey reports that Bush's run of sub-40% approval ratings, which has now extended to 6 months, is the longest sub-40% run of any President other than Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. [Truman has the record, 26 consecutive months below 40%.] 
<br><br>
President Bush's approval rating remains the lowest of any President who got this far into his 2nd term in the last 48 years.

How particular countries rate, as friends or foes, was a question put to Americans by a Quinnipiac University survey taken during the last week of April. Respondents were asked to rate countries from 1 to 100. The higher the number the more friendly the country is seen to be.

Abortion does not come up as an important issue when Americans are given an opportunity to offer up their most important issues. But it is one of those issues on which folks have very determined positions when the issue is raised. The Supreme Court has ruled that partial birth abortions may be barred. 66% of Americans agree with that proposition. 55% believe that the question of abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor; yet only 45% identify themselves as being pro-choice. [CNN/ORC 5/07;NBC/WSJ 4/07;CNN/ORC 5/07] 
<br><br>
Another issue that does not show up on volunteered issue lists in any appreciable numbers, but on which strong opinions are beginning to form, is global warming/climate change. Yet a March, 2007 Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner survey for The Center for American Progress found: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 76% believe the effects of global warming are apparent now.</li>
<br>
<li> 61% believe global warming is caused more by human actions than by naturally occurring forces.</li>
<br>
<li> 69% think the country's energy policy is off on the wrong track.</li>
<br>
<li> 79% have the view that shifting to new, alternative energy production will help American security and create jobs.</li>
</ul>
<br>
And, at least anecdotally, there is a partisan split on the relative importance of the issue. In the March 3rd National Journal Insiders Poll, the "Insiders" were asked to name the issue other than Iraq that is likely to get more attention in the 2008 election than most people expect. Democrats named global warming second in their list of six, after health 
care. Republicans did not name it in their top six. 
<br><br>
As much as anything else, the above responses may reflect the emphasis that the two Parties are likely to place on the issue in the coming election.
