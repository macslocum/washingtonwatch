Would you stay on the 13th floor of a hotel? 13% of us would be bothered if we were assigned a room on the 13th floor, and 9% of us would ask for a room on a different floor. Women are more skittish then men about staying on the 13th floor. [Gallup 2/07] 

<h2>100 Years Ago:</h2>

<ul>
<li> There were only 8,000 cars in the U.S., and only 144 miles of paved roads. The maximum speed limit in most cities was 10 mph.</li>
<br>
<li> The tallest structure in the world was the Eiffel Tower.</li>
<br>
<li> More than 95% of all births in the U.S. took place at home.</li>
<br>
<li> Sugar cost 4 cents a pound; eggs were 14 cents a dozen; coffee was 15 cents a pound.</li>
<br>
<li> The population of Las Vegas, Nevada was 30. [It was smaller than Searchlight, Nevada is today.]</li>
