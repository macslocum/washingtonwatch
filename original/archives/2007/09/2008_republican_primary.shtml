In much the way Clinton has done in the Democratic primary, Giuliani
has led the Republican primary field since January.&nbsp; He has
not been headed in any national poll during the period. Here are the
Gallup surveys, at roughly mid-month, since January. <br>

In the mid-August Gallup, Rudy Giuliani leads with 32%, followed by
Fred Thompson at 22%, Mitt Romney at 14%, and John McCain at 11%. <br>
<br>
There is less stability among the Republicans.&nbsp; 91% of
Republicans are familiar with Giuliani, 87% with McCain, 64% with
Romney, and 56% are familiar with Thompson. <br>
<br>
Only 46% of Republicans are able to rate all 4 of the top
candidates.&nbsp; Among this group <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thompson</span> leads
Giuliani by 33% to 25%, followed by Romney and McCain.&nbsp; Among
the larger group of Republicans (54%) who are not familiar with all 4
of the candidates, Giuliani leads with 38%, followed by McCain at 18%,
Thompson at 12%, and Romney at 6%. <br>
<br>
However, the Republican race has a different cast than the Democratic
race when the individual States are reviewed. <br>
<br>
Romney leads in 3 of the 4 States that are authorized before February
5th.&nbsp; Giuliani leads in 1. <br>
<br>
When it comes to the 2 outlier States, Romney has a slight lead over
Giuliani in Michigan, and Giuliani has a substantial lead in Florida.<br>
<br>
Giuliani has strong leads in California and New Jersey. <br>
<br>
There are no publicly available results from Wyoming, where the
Republicans plan to hold a caucus on January 5th. Here are averages of
polls in the aforementioned States as compiled by
RealClearPolitics.com.&nbsp; The number in () reflects the number
of surveys in the average. <br>

<h2>The Delegate Path to Nomination</h2>
<br>
There are 2,517 delegates to the 2008 Republican National Convention,
with 1,259 delegates required to secure the nomination. <br>
<br>
If Florida and Michigan do "lose" 1/2 of their delegates as results of
conducting primary elections outside the National Party-determined
window, the total number of delegates will be reduced to 2,430, and the
number needed to nominated is reduced to 1,216. <br>
<br>
Of the total delegates, 1852 are allocated based on primary and caucus
events, while 665 are unpledged delegates. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
You'll recall that in Vol.73, "The Washington Watch" pointed out that,
historically, the Republican candidate who has led in the Gallup poll
one year before the Republican convention was been the Party's
nominee.&nbsp; The relevant Gallup poll shows Rudy Giuliani has a
comfortable lead over the GOP field on September 1st, one year before
the start of the Republican convention. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
On September 6th, Fred Thompson became a formal candidate for the
Republican nomination.&nbsp; Will he do as well as an official
candidate as an "informal" candidate?&nbsp; Time will tell.<br>
<br>
Thompson first showed up in a Gallup survey in late March, registering
12% support.&nbsp; By mid-June he hit 19% and has not really grown
since then; in mid-August he scored 19%. [Although the circumstances
are different, Ronald Reagan did not announce his campaign for
President until November 13, 1979. He had previously announced a
Presidential campaign on November 20, 1975.&nbsp; See "&lt;a
href=""&gt;Let Us Remember&lt;/a&gt;".] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
John McCain's campaign is in a trough.&nbsp; It is hard to see how
he recovers.&nbsp; In the spring McCain was registering 20-25% in
national polls of Republican candidates.&nbsp; In recent polls he
has averaged 11%. <br>
<br>
In recent State polls of Republicans, McCain is running 5th in Iowa,
3rd in New Hampshire, 3rd in South Carolina, and 4th in Nevada. <br>
<br>
Documents being circulated by the McCain campaign equate his current
circumstances with those of Ronald Reagan in 1979.&nbsp; The big
difference is that Reagan was never bested in the Gallup national poll
during the primary election. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Keep an eye on Mike Huckabee.&nbsp; With little money, but an
engaging public presence and strong conservative credentials, the
former Governor of Arkansas is drawing attention.&nbsp; He is not
going to be the Republican nominee for President, but he could be quite
high on the V.P. list for someone like Giuliani.&nbsp; [He draws my
attention because he lost over 100 pounds, the hard way, and has kept
it off.]
