At the end of July, 67% said the country is on the wrong track. That is
pretty much what the mood has been for the last several months. <br>
<br>
The number who think the country is headed in the right direction, 19%,
is the same as it was in June, and is the lowest right direction number
during President Bush's tenure. [NBC/WSJ 7/07] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
49% of Republican voters and 71% of Independents say the country is on
the wrong track.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, 89% of Democrats also have
this view.&nbsp; [Battleground Poll 2008 7/07] <br>

Although it has bounced about a bit, the perception of the U.S. economy
by American consumers is down substantially since the first of the
year. <br>
<br>
33% now describe current conditions as excellent/good, whereas 52% gave
it that rating in January.&nbsp; Only 20% think it is getting
better, as opposed to 38% who had that view in January. [Gallup 8/07] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
30% of Americans think that their personal economic situation has
gotten worse in the past 12 months, while 22% say it has gotten
better.&nbsp; [NBC/WSJ 7/07] <br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

"Healthcare costs" heads the list of the most important financial
problems facing families today.&nbsp; 19% volunteered this issue,
followed by "a general lack of money/low wages" offered up by
15%.&nbsp; In 3rd place, with 8% each, are "cost of owning/renting
a home" and "energy costs/oil and gas prices."&nbsp; [Gallup 7/07] <br>
<br>
When given the option of selecting one or two items from a list of
possible economic concerns, 44% selected the "cost of healthcare" with
"jobs going overseas" being noted by 34%, and 22% selecting "the gap
between rich and poor."&nbsp; [NBC/WSJ 7/07] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Respondents to surveys are often asked to state one or two problems
that are most important, or that the President or the Congress should
tackle.&nbsp; Issues of a particular ilk are often lumped together
for purposes of reporting results, e.g., all issues that relate to the
economy. <br>
<br>
Alternatively, respondents are asked to select the most important issue
from a group of 6 to 10 issues selected by the pollster. <br>
<br>
In a mid-July, Lake Research/Tarrance Group did a survey in which they
asked respondents what they thought was the number 1 problem facing the
country, i.e, what problem they and their family are most concerned
about.&nbsp; Here are the results. <br>
<br>
Iraq (23%), immigration (10%), healthcare (cost/quality) (9%), economy
(6%), terrorism (5%), energy costs (gas for car) (4%), jobs
(3%).&nbsp; 7 other issues each garnered (2%) and 15 additional
issues each garnered (1%).&nbsp; [Abortion drew 1%] <br>
