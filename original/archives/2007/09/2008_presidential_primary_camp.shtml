<p></p>
The Presidential primary campaign is a play in multiple acts.&nbsp;
Act II has begun. <br>
<br>
During Act I the major candidates, for the most part, played quite
nicely together and were basically positive.&nbsp; In fact, they
might have been described as downright civil to each other. <br>
<br>
During Act II the gloves have come off: <br>
<br>
* Clinton described Obama as being "irresponsible and frankly
naive."&nbsp; Obama responded that the Clinton campaign was
"concocting a 'fabricated controversy'." <br>
<br>
* Obama called Clinton "Bush-Cheney lite."&nbsp; Clinton responded
that Obama was "getting kind of silly." <br>
<br>
* Dodd described as "irresponsible" Obama's seeming to support military
action against Al Quaeda in Pakistan. <br>
<br>
* Obama hit back at other candidates who criticized him on foreign
policy issues, commenting that he found it amusing that he was being
attacked by those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest
foreign policy disaster in this generation. <br>
<br>
* Obama referenced Clinton in saying that conventional wisdom passes
for experience in Washington. <br>
<br>
* Edwards took a shot at Clinton because she had appeared on the cover
of Fortune magazine. <br>
<br>
* Edwards, talking about all of the picket lines he had walked in the
last couple of years, was challenged by Biden, who asked him how many
picket lines he had walked while he was in the Senate. <br>
<br>
* After Clinton seemed to suggest that a terrorist attack in the next
few months would advantage the Republicans -- Dodd called her remarks
"tasteless," and Edwards and Richardson attacked her for dealing with
terrorism in a political context. <br>
<br>
* Romney charged that New York City, under Giuliani as Mayor, became a
magnet for illegal immigrants, and Giuliani said that Romney stood by,
looking the other way, as Governor of Massachusetts, when cities and
towns in that State declared themselves as "sanctuaries" for
immigrants. <br>
<br>
* Fred Thompson took a shot at Giuliani for Giuliani's strong support
of gun control when he was a Federal prosecutor and as Mayor of New
York.<br>
<br>
* McCain has called Romney a "flip flopper." <br>

Theoretically, the Iowa caucuses will be held January 14th, followed by
the Nevada caucuses on January 19th, the New Hampshire primary on the
22nd, and the South Carolina primary on January 29th.&nbsp; No
other event would occur before February in the Democratic primary
process. And, in the Republican contest there would be no contests at
all prior to February 5th. <br>
<br>
Scratch all of the above.&nbsp; There is no way that this exact
combination of events will occur in that order.&nbsp; In fact,
don't be surprised if you get up on Thanksgiving morning, 2007, and
realize that the Iowa caucuses were the previous Monday and the New
Hampshire primary is the next Tuesday. <br>
<br>
The following seems to have occurred, so far, to change the official
scenario. <br>
<br>
Florida decided to move its primary to the same date as the South
Carolina primary.&nbsp; This caused the Democratic Party Rules
Committee to strip Florida of all of its delegate votes. <br>
<br>
The South Carolina Republicans decided to move their primary to the
19th.&nbsp; The net result is that New Hampshire will move to the
12th or sooner because of its State law that requires that its primary
be at least 7 days before any other primary. <br>
<br>
Now Michigan is moving its primary to January 15th.&nbsp; The
Democrats will likely take away its delegates as well. <br>
<br>
Wyoming Republicans have decided to hold their caucuses on January 5th.
<br>
<br>
That also means that the New Hampshire primary will move to no later
than January 8th. <br>
<br>
And then there is Iowa, where State law says that its caucuses will be
held at least 8 days before the 1st primary. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
That takes the caucuses to December 31st.&nbsp; Well, of course,
the caucuses will not be held on New Year's Day. <br>
<br>
The Republican National Committee is likely to take similar actions
against Florida and Michigan, and perhaps South Carolina and
Wyoming.&nbsp; The apparent penalty is to take away half of a
State's delegates. <br>
<br>
Does it make any difference if these States lose their delegates to
their respective national Party conventions? <br>
<br>
Probably not.<br>
<br>
Long before the convention, the nominees of both Parties will be
known.&nbsp; As soon as the two conventions convene each will hear
a report from its Rules committee, likely recommending that the
delegates from the offending States not be seated.&nbsp; Of course,
by that time the nominee will effectively control the floor, so that
either the Rules committee will, at the request of the
nominee reinstate the delegates, or an effort will be made to get the
delegates to overrule the recommendation of the Rules Committee. <br>
<br>
All this proves once more that the conventions as we known them are at
best anachronisms, and at worst a major time and money drag.&nbsp;
It is long past the time to rethink their place in the scheme of
Presidential politics. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Democratic Party leaders in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and
Nevada, as well as National Party Chair Howard Dean, called upon the
candidates for the Democratic Party nomination, to honor the schedule
established by the Democratic National Committee. <br>
<br>
Obama, Biden, Richardson, Dodd, Edwards, and Clinton have announced
they will honor the Democratic Party schedule. Ostensibly, this means
that the candidates agree not to campaign in those two States and any
others that try to jump ahead of February 5th. <br>
<br>
Apparently, the pledge does not include fundraising.&nbsp; Can a
candidate show up in one of those States to attend a fundraiser on his
or her behalf?&nbsp; If that is permissible, does it include a
fundraiser that only charges $10-25 per head?&nbsp; Can a candidate
send mail, telephone calls or emails into those States?&nbsp; Stay <br>
tuned. <br>
<br>
Looking at the current polls in Florida and Michigan this does not
appear to be a "politically expensive" decision for anyone but
Clinton.&nbsp; As of mid-August, Clinton has a 21-point lead over
Obama in Florida, and a 16-point lead in Michigan. <br>

In 2004, the 4 States that the Democratic National Committee has
"allowed" to proceed with primaries and caucuses before the February
5th window opens had a total of 646,900 persons participating. <br>
<br>
This represents 3.8% of the total of 16,804,000 who participated in all
of the primaries and caucuses that year. <br>

Most significant candidates for President have declined to take public
financing in the primary period.&nbsp; There is some question
whether the two ultimate Party nominees will take general election
public financing.&nbsp; This has led to increasing calls for public
financing of elections.&nbsp; But public response is <br>
not all that clear.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In a WP/Kaiser/Harvard survey in May 2007, respondents were asked
whether they favored a system of public financing funded by the Federal
government, a system of private financing by individuals and political
groups, or a combination of the two. 16% chose public financing, 25%
private financing, and 55% a combination of the two. <br>
<br>
In a Gallup poll taken a month earlier, 22% chose public financing, 45%
chose private funding, and 28% chose a combination of the two. <br>
<br>
In a survey in early June, respondents were asked whether they
supported a system under which candidates would receive grants from a
public election fund and could not spend private donations.&nbsp;
74% supported such a system.&nbsp; Partisan support ranged from 80%
of Democrats and 78% of Independents to 65% of Republicans.&nbsp;
[Lake Research Partners/Bellwether Research] <br>
<br>
In an August survey, public financing by the Federal government was
deemed unacceptable by 57% of respondents. [Gallup 8/07] <br>
<br>
And in a totally open-ended question as to what the number one problem
is facing the country, that the respondents and their families are most
concerned about, campaign finance reform did not even hit the 1%
level.&nbsp; [Battleground Poll 2007 Tarrance Group &amp; Lake
Research Partners] <br>

<br>
The point is often made that early State polls, e.g., 6 months before
an election event, are not particularly good indicators of what will
ultimately happen.&nbsp; That is certainly true.&nbsp; If you
have any doubts, just track through the polling from the 2003
Democratic primary race. <br>
<br>
However, these polls do have an important effect.&nbsp; A good poll
for a particular candidate means a great deal to the psyche of the
volunteers and workers for that candidate. <br>
<br>
So, when in late July, the ABC/WP survey showed that Obama had moved up
in Iowa to a virtual tie with Clinton and Edwards, it surely gave heart
to his paid and volunteer staff in that State. <br>
