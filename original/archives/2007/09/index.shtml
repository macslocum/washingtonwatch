<h1>Tonic</h1>
(Aka Quigley's Pharmacy)<br>

Washington D.C. <br>

Fax 202-293-0063 <br>
Tonic to Go 202-296-0999
</div>The Tonic sign on the building is green, round and small. 
The Quigley's Pharmacy sign is white and large. 
<br><br>
There are three floors. 
<br><br>
The 1st floor is set up with a bar, with 14 high chairs and 
6 high tables, each with 4 chairs.  The restaurant has not yet 
received an alcoholic beverage license, so at this time only food 
is served at the bar.  The kitchen is at the back end of the 
room. 
<br><br>
The 2nd floor main dining room is reached by a pretty steep 
set of stairs.  Fortunately the steps are wide and there are 
strong rails on each side. 
<br><br>
There are a total of 72 seats in the main dining room; 2-2 
tops, 8-4  tops, 1-8 top, 5-4 person booths, and 1-8 person 
booth. At the back end of the room there is a "bridge" that leads 
to the restrooms and the stairwell to the kitchen.  If you look 
down from the sides of the bridge you can see parts of the 1st 
floor. 
<br><br>
The top floor is called the Lounge.  It is not yet open, but 
is likely to be opened during the school year. 
<br><br>
The walls are exposed brick.  The furnishings are simple, 
but comfortable, and the "table cloths" are white paper. 
<br><br>
It has the kind of menu that you secretly long for, but know 
you really should not eat. 
<br><br>
10 appetizers - soup to tater tots and Whiz Nachos (yes, 
that is nachos with cheese whiz). 
<br><br>
7 salads- grilled vegetable salad to an Asian tofu salad. 
<br><br>
6 sandwiches - grilled vegetable to Philly cheese steak. 
<br><br>
6 burgers - with added guacomole to cheezwhiz. 
<br><br>
7 - 10 inch pizzas plus a build-your-own combo. 
<br><br>
9 Entrees - Pulled pork plate to Blackened Catfish. 
<br><br>
An extensive dessert menu, ranging from Honey Raisin Bread 
Pudding to Old Fashioned Floats. 
<br><br>
There is also a weekly specials menu.  The week I was there 
it included an appetizer, Deep Fried Pickles - pickle spears, 
beer battered and deep fried, served with spicey honey, mustard 
dipping sauce.  Also a mile-high meatloaf sandwich on sourdough 
bread with mashed potatos and tomato gravy. 
<br><br>
At my first dinner I had the grilled vegetable salad - 
zucchini, squash, roasted red peppers, grilled onion, mixed 
greens, oil and vinegar, and Mama's Meatloaf - nice textured 
meatloaf with tomato gravy , macaroni and cheese, and collard 
greens.  (This is the way the dish comes on the menu.)  The mac 
and cheese is not too cheezy. 
<br><br>
At a subsequent lunch, I had a turkey burger with sauteed 
mushrooms and onions and tater tots. 
<br><br>
As you enter the men's room there is a white, squarish 
ceramic washbasin with a metal framed mirror dead ahead. 
<br><br>
To the left are 2 wall-hanging urinals, separated by partial 
unpainted fresh metal dividers.  Just past the second urinal is 
the commode area, which is enclosed in the same metal walls and 
door, open at top and bottom. 
<br><br>
The floor is covered with small tiles in 3 different colors; 
in the commode area they are brown, in the urinal section - light 
green, and in the entry way and under the wash basin - lite tan. 
<br><br>
The far wall as you enter is exposed brick; otherwise the 
walls are covered in tan mid-sized tiles on 3 sides to a height 
of about 3.5 feet, and then the rest of the walls are painted 
tan. 
<br><br>
Lunch time is generally packed, the evenings seem to be a 
little lighter, although that may change when the students are 
back on campus. 
<br><br>
I heard about Tonic from Erin who works there as a server. 
As you would expect the service was excellent. 
<br><br>
There are a couple of parking garages within an easy walk to 
the restaurant. 
<br><br>
Breakfast and lunch are served Monday - Friday with brunch 
served from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.  Dinner is 
served every night of the week.

<h1>Proof</h1>
775 G St. NW <br>
Washington, D.C<br>
202-737-7663 <br>
<a href="http://www.proofdc.com">www.proofdc.com</a>
</div>I went to Proof with Chris, which is always a treat given 
her knowledge of fine food and wine. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is one large area that is divided between a 
lounge and a dining room. 
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, the bar and lounge area are 
dead ahead.  The bar has 14 high stools. 
<br><br>
There is an "cruvinee" behind the bar.  It is not unusual to 
see a cruvinee that holds 3-4 bottles, but this one holds 32 
bottles.  It dispenses wines in your choice of 2, 6, and 8.5 
ounce portions.  (In modern parlance the cruvinee is called an 
Enomatic.) 
<br><br>
The lounge area will seat up to 35 people in total and the 
full menu is available.  However, I think there may well be too 
many people milling around the lounge on a busy night to fully 
enjoy a full dinner in this area. 
<br><br>
To the right, past the lounge, is the dining room.  It is 
set up in two long sections, with a divider lengthwise down the 
middle, which makes each side seem a little more intimate than if 
it were one large area.  The section on the left has 5 - 4-person 
booths, and there are also a number of 2 tops and 4 tops in this 
section.  In the section on the right there are 2 tops and 4 
tops.  In total the dining area will seat up to 84 people. 
<br><br>
At the far end of the room is a wine "cellar," with bottles 
visible through the floor to ceiling glass wall. 
<br><br>
To the left of the wine area there is a cheese station. 
Here, two folks work preparing portions of dozens of cheeses. 
Just past this station, if you look to the left, you can see the 
kitchen in action, and then you are at the restrooms.  More on 
them later. 
<br><br>
The whole restaurant is somewhat dim, but there is plenty of 
light around the bar and over the dining tables so those with 
slightly dimming vision can easily read the menu. 
<br><br>
The dinner menu has 6 sections: Charcuterie, First Courses, 
Second Courses, Alsos, Cheese and Desserts.
<br><br>
Under Charcuterie there are 12 choices ranging from 
Soppresetta to Marcona Almonds. 
<br><br>
13 First courses - Wagyu Beef Sashimi to Yukon Gold Potato 
Gnocchi. 
<br><br>
6 Second courses - Roasted Alaskan Halibut to Grilled Hanger 
Steak. 
<br><br>
4 Alsos - Roasted Wild Mushrooms to Sauteed Zucchini & 
Summer Squash. 
<br><br>
22 Cheeses - 8 Cow cheeses, 6 Sheep cheeses, 7 Goat cheeses, 
and 1 Blend. 
<br><br>
6 Desserts - Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake with vanilla ice 
cream and butterscotch sauce to Chocolate Bundt Cake with 
chocolate hazelnut mousse and chocolate sorbet. 
<br><br>
There is also a Chef's Six Course Tasting Menu, but everyone 
in the party has to participate. 
<br><br>
Chris and I shared the following: 
<br><br>
Starters - Jamon Serrano (Spanish ham); Pickled Okra; 
Roasted Baby Beets with sherry mustard vinaigrette, aged goat 
cheese, toasted hazelnuts; Roast Flatbreads with Ricotta, olive 
oil, lemon thyume, pea shoots, sea salts. 
<br><br>
Entrees - Glazed Sablefish, potato puree, pea shoots, wild 
mushrooms, miso sauce; Crispy Panko Chicken, lemongrass jasmine 
pilaf, slaw, salsa verde; Sauteed Baby Bok Choy. 
<br><br>
Dessert - Honeyed Goats Cheesecake, pink peppercorn 
shortbread, raspberries, passion fruit. 
<br><br>
Every dish was excellent. 
<br><br>
(On subsequent vists I was able to sample the Champagne 
Pate, the Stickey Toffee Pudding Cake with vanilla ice cream and 
butterscotch sauce, and the Grilled Lamb Burger served on a 
brioche bun with "chick pea fries (they look like thick french 
fries, but the taste is quite different). 
<br><br>
As you know, this writer is not a wine afficiando, but Chris 
is, and she described the wine selections as "one of the most 
impressive wine lists I have ever seen."  And she enjoyed those 
that she tasted.  Chris also noted that the glassware used for 
wine was as good as the wines. 
<br><br>
The wine list is expansive and many of the choices are 
downright expensive.  One bottle that caught my eye, St. Emilion, 
1947 Chateau Cheval Blanc, has a price of $11,000.  If that is a little pricey for you, the 1982 is $2,400 and the 1996 is 
available at the bargain price of $450. 
<br><br>
My friend Al Eisele, of "The Hill," has written in more 
detail about the wine collection.  Get a copy of "The Hill" for 
August 2nd, in the Capital Living section, for his comments. 
<br><br>
Maria was our serving person.  If there is a prize for the 
serving person who best represents the restaurant and all its 
qualities, Maria would certainly be in the finals, if not the 
ultimate winner. 
<br><br>
She spoke glowingly of her co-workers, the managers, the 
general working conditions, and how much she enjoyed working as a 
serving person.  When asked where else she had worked she ticked 
off a half dozen D.C. food emporiums, but made it clear that 
Proof was her favorite. 
<br><br>
When asked what wines she would suggest she asked about 
general preferences before making suggestions.  When asked about 
her favorites for various courses she had ready suggestions. 
Suffice to say, the service was excellent.  (Our service was 
significantly more attentive than Al reported in "The Hill," but 
we were in the dining room and he was in the lounge.) 
<br><br>
The men's room is dark, black and shiny. 
<br><br>
As you enter you face two, rather unusual, black wash 
basins.  There is no bowl in these washbasins.  Instead they are 
essentially flat, with a small channel that runs all the way 
around, ending with a drain at the back of the wash basin.  There 
is obviously enough slope in the center of the wash basin and in 
the channels so that water that hits the center of the wash basin 
runs off into the channels and thereafter to the drain. 
<br><br>
To the right are two black ceramic hanging urinals divided 
by a partial shiny black metal divider.  The back end of the room 
is the large commode area, that is walled off by partial black 
metal walls and doors. 
<br><br>
The floor is covered with large, dark charcoal grey, 
slightly spackled tiles.  The walls are covered with large black 
shiny tiles, except for the back wall of the commode area which 
is painted red from a height of about 4 feet to the ceiling. 
And then there is the art work.  From the far left wall, 
over the washbasins and into the commode area, there is a picture 
in the tiles of a nude supine women; she has no head and her 
chest is exposed.  Her feet are found inside the commode area. 
<br><br>
Each of the urinals also has similar artwork that catches the eye as you stand in front of the urinal.  Here the pictures are somewhat more defined.  On the right, a full posterior shot 
with head, that ends just below the buttocks.  On the left the 
picture is of a woman lying on her stomach at an angle. 
<br><br>
The ladies room (as reported to me) is quite striking and 
glamorous.  It is decorated in shocking pink and grey, including 
a pink commode seat.  There are full length mirrors, and the 
walls are covered in a retro foil wall paper. 
<br><br>
There is valet parking in the evening.

                        <h3 class="entry-header">2008 Congressional Campaign</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                                                            <div class="entry-body">
                                 In six national surveys taken after Congress had recessed for the month
of August, the average job approval rating for Congress was 22%, with
disapproval at 68%.&nbsp; [Polling Report, 8/6-8/22/07] <br>
<br>
The 18% approval rating recorded by Gallup in mid-August was the lowest
since it began rating the Congress in 1974.&nbsp; The only other
time in which this low an approval rating was scored was in March 1992,
at the time of the House banking scandal. <br>
<br>
The disapproval rating of 76% in August was the 2nd highest recorded,
the low point of a 78% disapproval rating coming in March
1992.&nbsp; [The high point for Congressional approval came after
9/11, when its approval rating hit 84% in October 2001.] <br>
<br>
The primary reasons for the high level of disapproval have to do with
inaction vs action as reflected in a more recent Gallup poll. <br>
<br>
Respondents were given the opportunity to express in their own words
the reasons why they disapprove of the Congress.&nbsp; 6 reasons
hit double digits: Not doing/passing anything (19%); Not making
progress in ending the war in Iraq (16%); Need to pay more attention to
the needs of the people (14%); Too partisan/Party politics (11%); Too
beholden to special interest/lobbyists (11%); Need to stand up to the
president more (10%).&nbsp; [Gallup 8/07] <br>
<br>
At the time the Democrats took back control of Congress in November
2006, the approval rating of Congress stood at 26%, <br>
disapproval at 63%. <br>
<br>
At this time in 1993, preceding Republican takeover of control of the
Congress in 1994, approval stood at 23% approval, 69% disapproval. <br>
<br>
As noted earlier, only 14% have a great deal/quite a lot of confidence
in the Congress as an institution. <br>
<br>
Yet in July, notwithstanding the fact that the Democrats have been in
charge for 8 months, when the NBC/WSJ tested 20 different issues on the
question of which Party would do a better job, the Democratic Party was
picked by respondents on 16 of the issues, including dealing with
global warming, healthcare, gas prices, energy policy, education,
homeownership, the economy, Iraq, immigration, ethics in government,
taxes, China, improving America's standing in the world, reducing the
Federal deficit, controlling government spending, and protecting
America's interest on trade issues. <br>
<br>
Republicans are seen as likely to do a better job on dealing with the
war on terrorism, promoting strong moral values, dealing with homeland
security, and promoting a strong military. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
There is a further apparent inconsistency between the low rating of the
Congress and the ratings that are given to the Democrats in Congress as
a group and the Republicans in Congress as a group. <br>
<br>
Democrats in Congress have an approval rating of 46% and Republicans in
Congress have an approval rating of 34%. <br>

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

Democrats&nbsp;&nbsp; 49 <br>
Republicans&nbsp; 49 <br>
Independents&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; (caucus Dem) <br>
<br>
Democrats are working hard to increase their span of control in the
Senate, and there are some possibilities.&nbsp; There are no
obvious races in which the Republicans are likely to pick up a seat. <br>
<br>
Colorado remains the most likely Democratic pickup.&nbsp; New
Hampshire as a possible Democratic pickup is still a possibility if
Jeanne Shaheen decides to run.&nbsp; So far there are no public
signs of a possible campaign on her part. <br>
<br>
Virginia will certainly be a target for an additional Democratic seat,
now that John Warner (R) has announced that he will not seek
re-election. Congressman Tom Davis (R) will likely seek the Republican
nomination to replace Warner, and there is a possibility that former
Governor Jim Gilmore, who early on entered and departed the
Presidential race, might decide that this is the race for
him.&nbsp; Former Democratic Governor Mark <br>
Warner, who eschewed a race for President and is often talked about as
a possible Vice Presidential pick, will likely enter the race. <br>
<br>
Mary Landrieu (D) seems to be a little stronger in Louisiana, with no
significant opponent emerging. Tim Johnson (D) of South Dakota is on a
path to return to the Senate right after Labor Day.&nbsp; Once that
happens the Republicans will likely gin up an opponent or two in short
order. Democrats continue to talk about the Maine race, with
Congressman Tom Allen (D) taking on incumbent Senator Susan Collins
(R).&nbsp; This has to be seen as a long shot.<br>
<br>
In Alaska, incumbent Ted Stevens (R) has a marginally positive
favorability rating, but in polling in a hypothetical Republican
primary against sitting Alaska Governor, Sarah Palin (R), he gets
beaten.&nbsp; There are no signs that Palin is thinking about
running against him.&nbsp; Incidentally, there are local <br>
supporters of the Governor who have launched a campaign to draft her as
the Vice Presidential candidate on the 2008 Republican national ticket.
<br>
<br>
Stevens is dealing with a continuing corruption scandal in Alaska in
which his name has come up along with that of his son. <br>
<br>
The strongest Democratic candidate against him would likely be Mark
Begich, the Mayor of Anchorage. <br>
<br>
In Minnesota, incumbent Norm Coleman (R) faces the reality that 49% of
Minnesotans would consider a new face in next year's
election.&nbsp; He has a negative job rating of 58%.&nbsp; On
the upside for him, he has a strong lead in hypothetical races against
his two possible Democratic opponents, Al Franken and Mike Ciresi. <br>

<br>
In the Democracy Corp compilation discussed previously, Democrats had a
9 point (51% to 42%) edge over the Republicans in a generic
congressional ballot. <br>

                        <div class="entry-content">
                                                            <div class="entry-body">
                                 Currently, two States, Nebraska (5 electoral votes) and 
Maine (4 electoral votes), allocate their electoral votes by 
Congressional districts.  In all other States electoral votes are 
allocated on a Statewide, winner-take-all basis. 
<br><br>
Earlier this year Democrats in North Carolina proposed 
allocating that State's 14 electoral votes on a Congressional 
District basis.  The goal was to pick up 4 electoral votes for 
Democratic Presidential candidates in a State that regularly 
delivers its electoral votes to the Republican candidate.  North 
Carolina Democrats were talked out of going forward with their 
plan. 
<br><br>
And then comes California.  An initiative has been filed, by 
a Republican lawyer, that would allocate the State's 55 electoral 
votes on the basis of Congressional Districts won, with the 
Statewide plurality or majority winner getting the extra 2 
electoral votes. 
<br><br>
An effort is being made to get the proposition on the 
June 3, 2008, State primary ballot.  If it succeeds, California's 
electoral votes would be allocated on a Congressional District 
basis in 2008. 
<br><br>
The first step for the proponents is to acquire the 433,971 
signatures required to get the proposition on the ballot.  If 
that effort is successful...standback!  Millions of dollars will 
flow into that contest, and there are no limits as to amounts or 
sources. 
<br><br>
To add to the drama, with the Presidential primary scheduled 
for February 5th, this will be the 2nd Statewide election in 
California in a 4-month period.  Turnout will likely be affected. 
If this had been the rule in 2000, George Bush would have 
received at least 19 additional votes, bringing his total 
electoral votes from 271 to 290.  Al Gore's total would have 
fallen from 266 to 247. 
<br><br>
In 2004, Bush would have picked up an additional 22 
electoral votes, raising his total votes from 286 to 308 and 
lowering John Kerry's total from 251 to 229. 
<br><br>
A recent Field poll (+/-4.5%) asked if respondents favor 
allocating the States' electoral votes on the current winner- 
take-all basis or on a District-by-District basis.  District-bDistrict won 47%-35%.  Democrats split dead even on the issue,
<br><br>
41%-42%.  Republicans supported change by 29 points, as did 
Independents by 9 points. 
<br><br>
Respondents were then told that if this method had been in 
place in the past 4 Presidential elections, Republicans would 
have received as many as 22 additional electoral votes. 
<br><br>
Democrats were then less inclined to support the change, by 43% - 
27%.  Republicans were more inclined to support the change 61%- 
14%, and Independents were less inclined to support change by 9 
points. 
<br><br>
Respondent preferences from both questions were then 
combined, with the result that change to the District-by-District 
method still won 49%-42%.  Democrats clearly opposed change, 53%- 
41%, as did Independents by 51%-37%.  Repsupported the change, 70%-24%.

<br>
While on the subject of electoral votes, here is what is 
likely to happen, in terms of House seats, after the 2010 census. 
8 states will gain seats - Texas +4; Arizona and Florida +2 
each; Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington +1 each. 
11 states will lose seats - New York and Ohio -2 each; 
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania -1 each. 
<br><br>
States won by Bush in 2004 will pick up 11 seats and lose 5 
seats.  States won by Kerry in 2004 will lose 8 seats and pick up 
2 seats.  This would have resulted in Bush winning in 2004 by 292 
electoral votes to 245 electoral votes. 
<br><br>
[For those of you whose instinct is to let me know that 
total electoral votes in each year only add up to 537, remember 
there was one faithless Democratic elector in each election.]

Potential voters who have a current choice in hypothetical general
election matchups, as well as those who do not have a current choice,
were asked whether they would vote for a 3rd Party candidate.&nbsp;
59% said no, 22% said yes, and 20% were unsure. <br>

When faced with Michael Bloomberg as a candidate, 82% said they would
not vote for him.&nbsp; [GWU Battleground Poll 7/07] <br>

In mid-August, Karl Rove gave a series of interviews following his
announcement that he was going to shortly leave the Administration. <br>
<br>
Among the things he said about Hillary Clinton, were "There is no
front-runner who has entered the primary season with negatives as high
as she has in the history of modern polling." <br>
<br>
"She enters the general election campaign with the highest negatives of
any candidate in the history of the Gallup Poll." <br>
<br>
He added that, as a result, she was "fatally flawed" in her quest for
election to the Presidency. <br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter, the Gallup Organization put out one of its regular
briefing memos with the intention of dealing with the Rove assertions. <br>
<br>
Among other things, Gallup wrote, "Clinton's current unfavorable
ratings are in reality not much different from what other past
candidates have had in the year they won election. Second, her image
has been more negative than positive several other times during the
past 15 years, but often has recovered and could do it again.&nbsp;
Last, despite Clinton's high unfavorables, she remains competitive with
the Republican candidates in Gallup's Presidential test elections." <br>

And then there is the 1979 Ronald Reagan campaign.&nbsp; In July
1979, his campaign reported that it was $20,000 in debt.&nbsp; By
September that debt had mounted to $500,000. <br>
<br>
There were a number of major shakeups in the campaign, with the last
one coming on the day of the New Hampshire primary &nbsp;(February
26), after Reagan had lost the Iowa Caucuses on January 21st.&nbsp;
Of course, Reagan went on to win the nomination and the general
election. <br>
<br>
Notably, he led in the Gallup poll nationally throughout this period.

                                 Politics is full of rituals.  The Republicans' Ames straw 
poll is one of them.  And like other rituals, at least in modern 
times, it doesn't seem to mean a whole lot in the broader scheme 
of things. 
<br><br>
What does seem to mean something is who is leading in the 
national polls at the time of the Ames straw poll. 
<br><br>
1979 - George Bush won the Straw poll with 36% of the vote, 
John Connolly and Bob Dole were 2nd, with 15% each.  Ronald 
Reagan led in the Gallup poll, 29% to Jerry Ford's 21%.  Reagan 
was nominated. 
<br><br>
1987 - Pat Robertson won the Straw poll with 34%, Bob Dole 
was 2nd with 25%, George Bush was 3rd with 23%.  Bush led in the 
Gallup, with 40% to Dole's 20%.  Bush was nominated. 
<br><br>
1995 - Bob Dole tied with Phil Gramm for 1st place in the 
Straw poll with 24%, and Pat Buchanan was 3rd with 18%.  Dole led 
in the Gallup, with 31% to Gramm's 8%.  Dole was nominated. 
<br><br>
1999 - George W. Bush won the Straw poll with 31%, Steve 
Forbes was 2nd with 21%.  Bush led in the Gallup with 61%.  Bush 
was nominated. 
<br><br>
2007 - Mitt Romney won the Straw poll with 32%, Mike 
Huckabee finished 2nd with 18%.  Rudy Giuliani was leading in the 
Gallup, with 30%, followed by Fred Thompson at 19%.  [?] was 
nominated.

By the way, only 14,306 folks showed up for the most recent

In the mid-August Gallup, Rudy Giuliani leads with 32%, followed by
Fred Thompson at 22%, Mitt Romney at 14%, and John McCain at 11%. <br>
<br>
There is less stability among the Republicans.&nbsp; 91% of
Republicans are familiar with Giuliani, 87% with McCain, 64% with
Romney, and 56% are familiar with Thompson. <br>
<br>
Only 46% of Republicans are able to rate all 4 of the top
candidates.&nbsp; Among this group <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thompson</span> leads
Giuliani by 33% to 25%, followed by Romney and McCain.&nbsp; Among
the larger group of Republicans (54%) who are not familiar with all 4
of the candidates, Giuliani leads with 38%, followed by McCain at 18%,
Thompson at 12%, and Romney at 6%. <br>
<br>
However, the Republican race has a different cast than the Democratic
race when the individual States are reviewed. <br>
<br>
Romney leads in 3 of the 4 States that are authorized before February
5th.&nbsp; Giuliani leads in 1. <br>
<br>
When it comes to the 2 outlier States, Romney has a slight lead over
Giuliani in Michigan, and Giuliani has a substantial lead in Florida.<br>
<br>
Giuliani has strong leads in California and New Jersey. <br>
<br>
There are no publicly available results from Wyoming, where the

<h2>The Delegate Path to Nomination</h2>
<br>
There are 2,517 delegates to the 2008 Republican National Convention,
with 1,259 delegates required to secure the nomination. <br>
<br>
If Florida and Michigan do "lose" 1/2 of their delegates as results of
conducting primary elections outside the National Party-determined
window, the total number of delegates will be reduced to 2,430, and the
number needed to nominated is reduced to 1,216. <br>
<br>
Of the total delegates, 1852 are allocated based on primary and caucus
events, while 665 are unpledged delegates. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
You'll recall that in Vol.73, "The Washington Watch" pointed out that,
historically, the Republican candidate who has led in the Gallup poll
one year before the Republican convention was been the Party's
nominee.&nbsp; The relevant Gallup poll shows Rudy Giuliani has a
comfortable lead over the GOP field on September 1st, one year before
the start of the Republican convention. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
On September 6th, Fred Thompson became a formal candidate for the
Republican nomination.&nbsp; Will he do as well as an official
candidate as an "informal" candidate?&nbsp; Time will tell.<br>
<br>
Thompson first showed up in a Gallup survey in late March, registering
12% support.&nbsp; By mid-June he hit 19% and has not really grown
since then; in mid-August he scored 19%. [Although the circumstances
are different, Ronald Reagan did not announce his campaign for
President until November 13, 1979. He had previously announced a
Presidential campaign on November 20, 1975.&nbsp; See "&lt;a
href=""&gt;Let Us Remember&lt;/a&gt;".] <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
John McCain's campaign is in a trough.&nbsp; It is hard to see how
he recovers.&nbsp; In the spring McCain was registering 20-25% in
national polls of Republican candidates.&nbsp; In recent polls he
has averaged 11%. <br>
<br>
In recent State polls of Republicans, McCain is running 5th in Iowa,
3rd in New Hampshire, 3rd in South Carolina, and 4th in Nevada. <br>
<br>
Documents being circulated by the McCain campaign equate his current
circumstances with those of Ronald Reagan in 1979.&nbsp; The big
difference is that Reagan was never bested in the Gallup national poll
during the primary election. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Keep an eye on Mike Huckabee.&nbsp; With little money, but an
engaging public presence and strong conservative credentials, the
former Governor of Arkansas is drawing attention.&nbsp; He is not
going to be the Republican nominee for President, but he could be quite
high on the V.P. list for someone like Giuliani.&nbsp; [He draws my
attention because he lost over 100 pounds, the hard way, and has kept
it off.]

In a mid-August Gallup poll, Hillary Clinton leads the field with 42%,
followed by Barack Obama at 21%, John Edwards at 11%. 94% of Democrats
say they are familiar enough with Clinton to rate her. 85% say that
about John Edwards, and 84% about Barack Obama. <br>
<br>
77% are familiar with all 3 candidates.&nbsp; Among those Democrats
that know all 3 of them, 43% support Clinton.&nbsp; She garners 53%
of the vote among Democrats who are not familiar Obama or Edwards or
both.&nbsp; [Gallup 8/07] <br>
<br>
It seems likely that, short of some significant mistake on the part of
one of the leading candidates, the relative positions of the candidates
in national surveys will continue at least until the Iowa caucuses. <br>
<br>
If another candidate, especially Obama, achieves a significant victory
in Iowa, the national momentum of the race could well change. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
There is a clear preference among Democrats and Democratic-leaning
Independents for a candidate "who has a strong desire to change the
system for getting things done in Washington" (73%) over a candidate
that "has experience getting things done in the current system in
Washington" (26%). <br>
<br>
96% say that it is desirable that the next President have the
characteristics to bring about change in Washington. However, 57% also
say that about having a lot of experience in Washington.&nbsp;
[Gallup 8/07]<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
When it comes to the individual early State races, the current results
are not that dissimilar to the national race. While in Iowa the #1
position has moved back and forth between Clinton and Edwards, and
Obama is very much in the mix, at least at this stage, Clinton leads in
most key races. <br>
<br>
Among the 4 States authorized by the DNC to hold contests before
February 5th, she has clear leads in 3 of 4.&nbsp; In the 2
pre-February 5th outliers, Florida and Michigan, she has substantial
leads in each.&nbsp; And a quick look at a couple of large February
5th States, California and New Jersey, shows Clinton having commanding
leads in both. <br>

<h2>The Delegate Path to Nomination</h2>
There are 4,360 delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention,
with 2,181 delegates required to secure the nomination. <br>
<br>
If Florida and Michigan do "lose" their delegates as a result of
conducting primary elections outside the National Party-determined
window, the total number of delegates will be reduced to 3,994, and the
number needed to be nominated is reduced to 1998. <br>
<br>
Of the total delegates, 3512 are allocated based on primary and caucus
events, while 848 are automatic and unpledged delegates [the so-called
"super delegates"]. <br>
<br>
Pollster.com does an "analysis" of the number of delegates "won" by
each candidate, based on the latest State polls (some owhich are quite
old) and not allocating delegates from any State in which there are no
polls.&nbsp; [The analysis ostensibly follows the apportionment
rules of the Democratic Party.] <br>
As of September 2nd, that analysis shows Clinton - 1223; Obama - 676;
Edwards - 473; and Richardson - 129.

<br>
Technically there are 8 Republicans and 8 Democrats still in the
race.&nbsp; The reality is something else. <br>
<br>
There is 1 Republican likely yet to get in - Fred Thompson - and 2
Republicans who are still in the "wait and see" mode, Newt Gingrich and
Chuck Hagel. <br>
<br>
There is 1 Democrat in the "wait and see" mode - Al Gore. There are
long shots in the field, e.g., Republican Mike Huckabee; and then there
are the "longest of long shots," e.g., Democrat Dennis Kucinich. <br>
<br>
The chart that follows has been modified accordingly. <br>
<br>
There is still no word as to whether the Green Party will field a
candidate.&nbsp; Mike Bloomberg has said quite specifically that he
will not be a candidate, and Sam Nunn has now suggested that he might
enter as an Independent candidate,the "Unity '08" banner. <br>

                                 The Presidential primary campaign is a play in multiple acts.&nbsp;
Act II has begun. <br>
<br>
During Act I the major candidates, for the most part, played quite
nicely together and were basically positive.&nbsp; In fact, they
might have been described as downright civil to each other. <br>
<br>
During Act II the gloves have come off: <br>
<br>
* Clinton described Obama as being "irresponsible and frankly
naive."&nbsp; Obama responded that the Clinton campaign was
"concocting a 'fabricated controversy'." <br>
<br>
* Obama called Clinton "Bush-Cheney lite."&nbsp; Clinton responded
that Obama was "getting kind of silly." <br>
<br>
* Dodd described as "irresponsible" Obama's seeming to support military
action against Al Quaeda in Pakistan. <br>
<br>
* Obama hit back at other candidates who criticized him on foreign
policy issues, commenting that he found it amusing that he was being
attacked by those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest
foreign policy disaster in this generation. <br>
<br>
* Obama referenced Clinton in saying that conventional wisdom passes
for experience in Washington. <br>
<br>
* Edwards took a shot at Clinton because she had appeared on the cover
of Fortune magazine. <br>
<br>
* Edwards, talking about all of the picket lines he had walked in the
last couple of years, was challenged by Biden, who asked him how many
picket lines he had walked while he was in the Senate. <br>
<br>
* After Clinton seemed to suggest that a terrorist attack in the next
few months would advantage the Republicans -- Dodd called her remarks
"tasteless," and Edwards and Richardson attacked her for dealing with
terrorism in a political context. <br>
<br>
* Romney charged that New York City, under Giuliani as Mayor, became a
magnet for illegal immigrants, and Giuliani said that Romney stood by,
looking the other way, as Governor of Massachusetts, when cities and
towns in that State declared themselves as "sanctuaries" for
immigrants. <br>
<br>
* Fred Thompson took a shot at Giuliani for Giuliani's strong support
of gun control when he was a Federal prosecutor and as Mayor of New
York.<br>
<br>
* McCain has called Romney a "flip flopper." <br>

<br>
Theoretically, the Iowa caucuses will be held January 14th, followed by
the Nevada caucuses on January 19th, the New Hampshire primary on the
22nd, and the South Carolina primary on January 29th.&nbsp; No
other event would occur before February in the Democratic primary
process. And, in the Republican contest there would be no contests at
all prior to February 5th. <br>
<br>
Scratch all of the above.&nbsp; There is no way that this exact
combination of events will occur in that order.&nbsp; In fact,
don't be surprised if you get up on Thanksgiving morning, 2007, and
realize that the Iowa caucuses were the previous Monday and the New
Hampshire primary is the next Tuesday. <br>
<br>
The following seems to have occurred, so far, to change the official
scenario. <br>
<br>
Florida decided to move its primary to the same date as the South
Carolina primary.&nbsp; This caused the Democratic Party Rules
Committee to strip Florida of all of its delegate votes. <br>
<br>
The South Carolina Republicans decided to move their primary to the
19th.&nbsp; The net result is that New Hampshire will move to the
12th or sooner because of its State law that requires that its primary
be at least 7 days before any other primary. <br>
<br>
Now Michigan is moving its primary to January 15th.&nbsp; The
Democrats will likely take away its delegates as well. <br>
<br>
Wyoming Republicans have decided to hold their caucuses on January 5th.
<br>
<br>
That also means that the New Hampshire primary will move to no later
than January 8th. <br>
<br>
And then there is Iowa, where State law says that its caucuses will be
held at least 8 days before the 1st primary. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
That takes the caucuses to December 31st.&nbsp; Well, of course,
the caucuses will not be held on New Year's Day. <br>
<br>
The Republican National Committee is likely to take similar actions
against Florida and Michigan, and perhaps South Carolina and
Wyoming.&nbsp; The apparent penalty is to take away half of a
State's delegates. <br>
<br>
Does it make any difference if these States lose their delegates to
their respective national Party conventions? <br>
<br>
Probably not.<br>
<br>
Long before the convention, the nominees of both Parties will be
known.&nbsp; As soon as the two conventions convene each will hear
a report from its Rules committee, likely recommending that the
delegates from the offending States not be seated.&nbsp; Of course,
by that time the nominee will effectively control the floor, so that
either the Rules committee will, at the request of the
nominee reinstate the delegates, or an effort will be made to get the
delegates to overrule the recommendation of the Rules Committee. <br>
<br>
All this proves once more that the conventions as we known them are at
best anachronisms, and at worst a major time and money drag.&nbsp;
It is long past the time to rethink their place in the scheme of
Presidential politics. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Democratic Party leaders in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and
Nevada, as well as National Party Chair Howard Dean, called upon the
candidates for the Democratic Party nomination, to honor the schedule
established by the Democratic National Committee. <br>
<br>
Obama, Biden, Richardson, Dodd, Edwards, and Clinton have announced
they will honor the Democratic Party schedule. Ostensibly, this means
that the candidates agree not to campaign in those two States and any
others that try to jump ahead of February 5th. <br>
<br>
Apparently, the pledge does not include fundraising.&nbsp; Can a
candidate show up in one of those States to attend a fundraiser on his
or her behalf?&nbsp; If that is permissible, does it include a
fundraiser that only charges $10-25 per head?&nbsp; Can a candidate
send mail, telephone calls or emails into those States?&nbsp; Stay <br>
tuned. <br>
<br>
Looking at the current polls in Florida and Michigan this does not
appear to be a "politically expensive" decision for anyone but
Clinton.&nbsp; As of mid-August, Clinton has a 21-point lead over
Obama in Florida, and a 16-point lead in Michigan. <br>

Most significant candidates for President have declined to take public
financing in the primary period.&nbsp; There is some question
whether the two ultimate Party nominees will take general election
public financing.&nbsp; This has led to increasing calls for public
financing of elections.&nbsp; But public response is <br>
not all that clear.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In a WP/Kaiser/Harvard survey in May 2007, respondents were asked
whether they favored a system of public financing funded by the Federal
government, a system of private financing by individuals and political
groups, or a combination of the two. 16% chose public financing, 25%
private financing, and 55% a combination of the two. <br>
<br>
In a Gallup poll taken a month earlier, 22% chose public financing, 45%
chose private funding, and 28% chose a combination of the two. <br>
<br>
In a survey in early June, respondents were asked whether they
supported a system under which candidates would receive grants from a
public election fund and could not spend private donations.&nbsp;
74% supported such a system.&nbsp; Partisan support ranged from 80%
of Democrats and 78% of Independents to 65% of Republicans.&nbsp;
[Lake Research Partners/Bellwether Research] <br>
<br>
In an August survey, public financing by the Federal government was
deemed unacceptable by 57% of respondents. [Gallup 8/07] <br>
<br>
And in a totally open-ended question as to what the number one problem
is facing the country, that the respondents and their families are most
concerned about, campaign finance reform did not even hit the 1%
level.&nbsp; [Battleground Poll 2007 Tarrance Group &amp; Lake
Research Partners] <br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
The point is often made that early State polls, e.g., 6 months before
an election event, are not particularly good indicators of what will
ultimately happen.&nbsp; That is certainly true.&nbsp; If you
have any doubts, just track through the polling from the 2003
Democratic primary race. <br>
<br>
However, these polls do have an important effect.&nbsp; A good poll
for a particular candidate means a great deal to the psyche of the
volunteers and workers for that candidate. <br>
<br>
So, when in late July, the ABC/WP survey showed that Obama had moved up
in Iowa to a virtual tie with Clinton and Edwards, it surely gave heart
to his paid and volunteer staff in that State. <br>

economy. <br>

Alternatively, respondents are asked to select the most important issue
