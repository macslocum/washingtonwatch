At this time in 1991, Mario Cuomo was still leading in national polls
in the Democratic primary. &nbsp;In 2003 by this time, Lieberman
had lost his lead to Dick 
Gephardt, who was leading marginally over Dean, Lieberman, Kerry, and
Clark in that order. <br>
<br>

<br>
And then there is the 1979 Ronald Reagan campaign.&nbsp; In July
1979, his campaign reported that it was $20,000 in debt.&nbsp; By
September that debt had mounted to $500,000. <br>
<br>
There were a number of major shakeups in the campaign, with the last
one coming on the day of the New Hampshire primary &nbsp;(February
26), after Reagan had lost the Iowa Caucuses on January 21st.&nbsp;
Of course, Reagan went on to win the nomination and the general
election. <br>
<br>
Notably, he led in the Gallup poll nationally throughout this period.
