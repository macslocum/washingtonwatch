<p></p>
Politics is full of rituals.  The Republicans' Ames straw 
poll is one of them.  And like other rituals, at least in modern 
times, it doesn't seem to mean a whole lot in the broader scheme 
of things. 
<br><br>
What does seem to mean something is who is leading in the 
national polls at the time of the Ames straw poll. 
<br><br>
1979 - George Bush won the Straw poll with 36% of the vote, 
John Connolly and Bob Dole were 2nd, with 15% each.  Ronald 
Reagan led in the Gallup poll, 29% to Jerry Ford's 21%.  Reagan 
was nominated. 
<br><br>
1987 - Pat Robertson won the Straw poll with 34%, Bob Dole 
was 2nd with 25%, George Bush was 3rd with 23%.  Bush led in the 
Gallup, with 40% to Dole's 20%.  Bush was nominated. 
<br><br>
1995 - Bob Dole tied with Phil Gramm for 1st place in the 
Straw poll with 24%, and Pat Buchanan was 3rd with 18%.  Dole led 
in the Gallup, with 31% to Gramm's 8%.  Dole was nominated. 
<br><br>
1999 - George W. Bush won the Straw poll with 31%, Steve 
Forbes was 2nd with 21%.  Bush led in the Gallup with 61%.  Bush 
was nominated. 
<br><br>
2007 - Mitt Romney won the Straw poll with 32%, Mike 
Huckabee finished 2nd with 18%.  Rudy Giuliani was leading in the 
Gallup, with 30%, followed by Fred Thompson at 19%.  [?] was 
nominated.

By the way, only 14,306 folks showed up for the most recent 
Straw poll.
