					<h3><a href="#">2008 Congressional Campaign</a></h3>

<p></p>
In six national surveys taken after Congress had recessed for the month
of August, the average job approval rating for Congress was 22%, with
disapproval at 68%.&nbsp; [Polling Report, 8/6-8/22/07] <br>
<br>
The 18% approval rating recorded by Gallup in mid-August was the lowest
since it began rating the Congress in 1974.&nbsp; The only other
time in which this low an approval rating was scored was in March 1992,
at the time of the House banking scandal. <br>
<br>
The disapproval rating of 76% in August was the 2nd highest recorded,
the low point of a 78% disapproval rating coming in March
1992.&nbsp; [The high point for Congressional approval came after
9/11, when its approval rating hit 84% in October 2001.] <br>
<br>
The primary reasons for the high level of disapproval have to do with
inaction vs action as reflected in a more recent Gallup poll. <br>
<br>
Respondents were given the opportunity to express in their own words
the reasons why they disapprove of the Congress.&nbsp; 6 reasons
hit double digits: Not doing/passing anything (19%); Not making
progress in ending the war in Iraq (16%); Need to pay more attention to
the needs of the people (14%); Too partisan/Party politics (11%); Too
beholden to special interest/lobbyists (11%); Need to stand up to the
president more (10%).&nbsp; [Gallup 8/07] <br>
<br>
At the time the Democrats took back control of Congress in November
2006, the approval rating of Congress stood at 26%, <br>
disapproval at 63%. <br>
<br>
At this time in 1993, preceding Republican takeover of control of the
Congress in 1994, approval stood at 23% approval, 69% disapproval. <br>
<br>
As noted earlier, only 14% have a great deal/quite a lot of confidence
in the Congress as an institution. <br>
<br>
Yet in July, notwithstanding the fact that the Democrats have been in
charge for 8 months, when the NBC/WSJ tested 20 different issues on the
question of which Party would do a better job, the Democratic Party was
picked by respondents on 16 of the issues, including dealing with
global warming, healthcare, gas prices, energy policy, education,
homeownership, the economy, Iraq, immigration, ethics in government,
taxes, China, improving America's standing in the world, reducing the
Federal deficit, controlling government spending, and protecting
America's interest on trade issues. <br>
<br>
Republicans are seen as likely to do a better job on dealing with the
war on terrorism, promoting strong moral values, dealing with homeland
security, and promoting a strong military. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
There is a further apparent inconsistency between the low rating of the
Congress and the ratings that are given to the Democrats in Congress as
a group and the Republicans in Congress as a group. <br>
<br>
Democrats in Congress have an approval rating of 46% and Republicans in
Congress have an approval rating of 34%. <br>

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

Democrats&nbsp;&nbsp; 49 <br>
Republicans&nbsp; 49 <br>
Independents&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; (caucus Dem) <br>
<br>
Democrats are working hard to increase their span of control in the
Senate, and there are some possibilities.&nbsp; There are no
obvious races in which the Republicans are likely to pick up a seat. <br>
<br>
Colorado remains the most likely Democratic pickup.&nbsp; New
Hampshire as a possible Democratic pickup is still a possibility if
Jeanne Shaheen decides to run.&nbsp; So far there are no public
signs of a possible campaign on her part. <br>
<br>
Virginia will certainly be a target for an additional Democratic seat,
now that John Warner (R) has announced that he will not seek
re-election. Congressman Tom Davis (R) will likely seek the Republican
nomination to replace Warner, and there is a possibility that former
Governor Jim Gilmore, who early on entered and departed the
Presidential race, might decide that this is the race for
him.&nbsp; Former Democratic Governor Mark <br>
Warner, who eschewed a race for President and is often talked about as
a possible Vice Presidential pick, will likely enter the race. <br>
<br>
Mary Landrieu (D) seems to be a little stronger in Louisiana, with no
significant opponent emerging. Tim Johnson (D) of South Dakota is on a
path to return to the Senate right after Labor Day.&nbsp; Once that
happens the Republicans will likely gin up an opponent or two in short
order. Democrats continue to talk about the Maine race, with
Congressman Tom Allen (D) taking on incumbent Senator Susan Collins
(R).&nbsp; This has to be seen as a long shot.<br>
<br>
In Alaska, incumbent Ted Stevens (R) has a marginally positive
favorability rating, but in polling in a hypothetical Republican
primary against sitting Alaska Governor, Sarah Palin (R), he gets
beaten.&nbsp; There are no signs that Palin is thinking about
running against him.&nbsp; Incidentally, there are local <br>
supporters of the Governor who have launched a campaign to draft her as
the Vice Presidential candidate on the 2008 Republican national ticket.
<br>
<br>
Stevens is dealing with a continuing corruption scandal in Alaska in
which his name has come up along with that of his son. <br>
<br>
The strongest Democratic candidate against him would likely be Mark
Begich, the Mayor of Anchorage. <br>
<br>
In Minnesota, incumbent Norm Coleman (R) faces the reality that 49% of
Minnesotans would consider a new face in next year's
election.&nbsp; He has a negative job rating of 58%.&nbsp; On
the upside for him, he has a strong lead in hypothetical races against
his two possible Democratic opponents, Al Franken and Mike Ciresi. <br>

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>
Democrats 233 (2 vacancies) <br>
Republicans 202 <br>
<br>
It is still quite early to get a handle on whether the alignment in the
House is likely to change in the 2008 election. <br>
<br>
In the Democracy Corp compilation discussed previously, Democrats had a
9 point (51% to 42%) edge over the Republicans in a generic
congressional ballot. <br>
