The Republican Party has a post-election approval rating of 42%, up from a late 2013 approval rating of 28%.
<br><br>
53% now want the Republicans in Congress to set the nation’s course for the next year, as opposed to 36% who want that role for President Obama. [Gallup]

In early November, Americans believed the most important issues the country is facing were: Economy in general – 28%; Dissatisfaction with government – 19%; Immigration/illegal aliens – 13%; and Unemployment/Jobs – 12%. Healthcare is selected by 7%. [Gallup]

The presiding officer in the United States Senate is always a member of the Majority party in the Senate, except when the Vice President of the United States decides to preside.
<br><br>
With Republicans in the majority when the Senate convenes in 2015, they will preside. Of the 53 Republicans whose election is now assured, 63% have not been in the Senate long enough to have presided when the Republicans were last in the majority. While those watching from the outside might see the time presiding as relatively boring, it provides an opportunity for those presiding to interact with the Parliamentarian and other Senate officers (they are not Senators), and to learn the rules and ways of the Senate.

<h2>The Next Elections have Clearly Begun</h2>

I received my last request for money for the 2014 election at 5:06 p.m. on election day, November 4th. I received numerous requests for contributions for 2016 races before the 2014 election. I received my first postelection request for a contribution for 2016 on November 7th. And, at 4:00 p.m. on November 5th , I received my first request for a contribution for 2018.

*The RCP averages for the Maryland and Vermont races were not provided by RealClearPolitics, so an average from several polls taken closest to the election has been calculated and used to calculate the difference.
<br><br>
*<strong>Note</strong>: The RCP often includes surveys to which WW would ordinarily not give much credence but they are in most cases mixed with surveys to which WW does give credence.

                                 One of the best analyses of the 2014 election was produced by Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. It is based on pre-election and post- election surveys by Public Opinion Strategies, the NBC/WSJ national survey, and national exit polls.
<br><br>
Going into the 2014 election, 63% of registered voters believed that the country was on the wrong track, the highest number for a mid-term election going back to 1990. In 2014, this included 89% of Republicans, 64% of Independents and 41% of Democrats.
<br><br>
Obama’s disapproval rating going into the election, at 55%,was consistent with other Presidents’ in years in which their Partys got smacked in a mid-term election. The disapproval scores were Clinton 1994 – 49%, Bush 2006 – 57%, Obama 2010-55%.
<br><br>
65% of likely voters were contacted by one campaign or another.
<br><br>
Republicans had a 6% point advantage in the generic Congressional ballot. Independents favored Republicans by 16% points. Independents are consistently tipping the scales to one Party or the other.
<br><br>
By 32% to 17% voters said their vote was in opposition to President Obama. 86% of those who approved the job being done by Obama voted Democratic. 87% of those who disapprove of the job being done by Obama voted Republican.
<br><br>
Men went Republican by +20% <br>
Women went Democratic by +6% <br>
Whites went Republicans by +23% <br>
Non-whites went Democratic by +44%
<br><br>
60% of voters made up their minds in September or earlier <br>
24% made up their minds in October<br>
15% decided in the last few days before the election
<br><br>
The later voters decided, the more likely they were to vote Democratic for Congress. However, the generic Congressional ballot was tied among those who voted early and swung Republican on Election day.
<br><br>
34% of voters cast their ballots early. In 2006, the number of early voters was 23% and in 2010, it was 27%. There is no difference among Republicans, Democrats and Independents in the number of early voters.

                                 The story of the 2014 election is very simple. At each elected level of the Federal and State governments...with the exception of the White House, which was not on the ballot...the Republicans won handily, increasing their margin of control. Turnout (on a percentage basis) was the worst it has been since the 1942 national election.
