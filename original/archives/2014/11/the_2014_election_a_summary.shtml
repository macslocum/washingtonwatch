<p></p>
The story of the 2014 election is very simple. At each elected level of the Federal and State governments...with the exception of the White House, which was not on the ballot...the Republicans won handily, increasing their margin of control. Turnout (on a percentage basis) was the worst it has been since the 1942 national election.
