12% of Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its work. This is slightly higher than the all-time Gallup low of 9% in October 2013. The high point of the last 16 months was15% approval in late 2012. Approval by Republicans is at 23%, but among Democrats it is 7%.
<br><br>
Of perhaps greater import, the percentage of Americans who think their Member of Congress deserves re-election (46%) has fallen to a new low. The high point in the last 22 years was 69% in 1998. Furthermore, the percentage of Americans who think that most Members of Congress deserve re-election (17%) has also fallen to an all-time low.
<br><br>

Much is being made of late of the number of Members of the Senate and the House who so far this cycle have announced their retirement or are otherwise leaving one body or the other. The latest is John Dingell (D-MI), the longest serving member of either body, who announced his retirement earlier this week.
<br><br>
The reality is that there is nothing unusual about the number of departures, at least so far. The chart that follows shows why Members depart. For example, so far in the 113th Congress, 12 of the 45 House Members who have announced their retirement are doing do to run for other office – 12 for the Senate.
<br><br>
In fact, the number of departures in the 111th (128) and the number of departures in the 112th (106), well exceed the number that are likely to depart in the 113th.

Party control of the U.S. Senate is in play. Of the 55 current Democratic seats, including two independents, three seats will switch unless something extraordinary occurs, Montana, West Virginia, and South Dakota.
<br><br>
There are 7 Toss-Up seats, 5 of which are currently held by Democrats and 2 by Republicans. If the Republicans hold on to their 2 Toss-Up seats they need to pick up 3 of the Democratic seats to gain control or 2 to guarantee that V.P Biden will be spending a lot of time in the Senate.
<br><br>
Of the two Republican toss-up seats, a Republican observer, in whom I have great confidence, said he was confident that McConnell will pull it out, “he will bring a gun to a knife fight.”

There is no chance that the Democrats will regain control of the House. In fact, an argument can be made that the Republicans will increase their margin of control.
