First there was the Deli, then the Market, then Spring Valley Catering, and finally Wagshal’s on New Mexico.
<br><br>
The Deli is like a traditional deli, with cold meats, salads, and a very long list of sandwiches that are prepared to order. There is a fresh baked goods section, ranging from fancy cakes to bagels, rolls and breads. There are refrigerated prepared meals, and individual soups and other treats; a hot bar with soups and other items; a variety of cold drinks (including Dr. Brown’s Diet Cream Soda); and wine and beer. I recommend the stuffed baked potatoes, and if you have never tried a brisket sandwich, this is the place to try it.

You place an order for a sandwich or cut meats at a counter and get a number. Your number is called when it is ready.

It can get pretty crowded, especially around noon time, and there is not a lot of room to hang around.

If the weather is half-way decent, there are a few tables and chairs set up on the sidewalk.

The Market offers a vast array of meats, fresh seafood, game, and sausages. There is a very good salad bar, and a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. There are baked goods and pastries, some frozen prepared items, various bottled non- alcoholic drinks, and bouquets of fresh flowers.

Presiding over the market is Pam Ginzberg, the lead butcher. If you have some special cut that you want, if it is humanly possible, Pam will carve it. Watching her operate is worth a visit.

From 10:30 a.m. till 2:30 p.m. you can order good-sized hamburgers, turkey burgers, and 1⁄4 pound hot dogs are prepared while you wait.

In decent weather there is an array of fresh vegetables, obviously on their first stop after coming out of the ground or being harvested.

Wagshal’s on New Mexico is a modern combination of the Deli and the Market. It is larger than the Deli and the Market combined. You can find anything from corned beef to prime steaks to lox to various salads. There are fresh bakery goods, pastries, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Large coolers contain a variety of prepared items, cheese, and smoked fish.

When you order a sandwich you get a number and one of the staff will find you with your order.

One of the things that makes the new Wagshal’s particularly inviting is that a number of the long-time staff from the Deli are now a part of their staff, so if you were/are a regular at the Deli you are welcomed in a familiar way.

One of the advantages of the new Waghsal’s is the large number of tables and chairs both inside and outdoors.

I have not tried Spring Valley Catering, but have talked with others who have used their services and offerings, and who have been very pleased.

All of these locations have parking lots available. During the daytime, the lot at Wagshal’s on New Mexico is a pay lot, but they will stamp your parking ticket.
