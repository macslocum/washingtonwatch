First there was the Deli, then the Market, then Spring Valley Catering, and finally Wagshal’s on New Mexico.
<br><br>
The Deli is like a traditional deli, with cold meats, salads, and a very long list of sandwiches that are prepared to order. There is a fresh baked goods section, ranging from fancy cakes to bagels, rolls and breads. There are refrigerated prepared meals, and individual soups and other treats; a hot bar with soups and other items; a variety of cold drinks (including Dr. Brown’s Diet Cream Soda); and wine and beer. I recommend the stuffed baked potatoes, and if you have never tried a brisket sandwich, this is the place to try it.

You place an order for a sandwich or cut meats at a counter and get a number. Your number is called when it is ready.

It can get pretty crowded, especially around noon time, and there is not a lot of room to hang around.

If the weather is half-way decent, there are a few tables and chairs set up on the sidewalk.

<br><br>

<br>

The Market offers a vast array of meats, fresh seafood, game, and sausages. There is a very good salad bar, and a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. There are baked goods and pastries, some frozen prepared items, various bottled non- alcoholic drinks, and bouquets of fresh flowers.

Presiding over the market is Pam Ginzberg, the lead butcher. If you have some special cut that you want, if it is humanly possible, Pam will carve it. Watching her operate is worth a visit.

From 10:30 a.m. till 2:30 p.m. you can order good-sized hamburgers, turkey burgers, and 1⁄4 pound hot dogs are prepared while you wait.

In decent weather there is an array of fresh vegetables, obviously on their first stop after coming out of the ground or being harvested.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Wagshal’s on New Mexico is a modern combination of the Deli and the Market. It is larger than the Deli and the Market combined. You can find anything from corned beef to prime steaks to lox to various salads. There are fresh bakery goods, pastries, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Large coolers contain a variety of prepared items, cheese, and smoked fish.

When you order a sandwich you get a number and one of the staff will find you with your order.

One of the things that makes the new Wagshal’s particularly inviting is that a number of the long-time staff from the Deli are now a part of their staff, so if you were/are a regular at the Deli you are welcomed in a familiar way.

One of the advantages of the new Waghsal’s is the large number of tables and chairs both inside and outdoors.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

I have not tried Spring Valley Catering, but have talked with others who have used their services and offerings, and who have been very pleased.

All of these locations have parking lots available. During the daytime, the lot at Wagshal’s on New Mexico is a pay lot, but they will stamp your parking ticket.

<h2>My Evolution on Gay Rights</h2>

By Charlie Cook, January 23, 2014 <br>
<a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-cook-report/my-evolution-on-gay-rights-20140123">nationaljournal.com/the-cook-report</a>
<br><br>
As recently as a decade ago, the marriage-equality movement looked like a long, tough slog. Today, about 55 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage; it is now legal in 17 states, seven of those having acted in the past year alone. The civil-rights journey for African-Americans took more than a century. The women’s suffrage movement began in colonial days and wasn’t finished until the early 20th century. But the equal-rights movement for gays gained momentum in what seems like the blink of an eye, beginning with the Massachusetts Supreme Court’s 2003 decision allowing same-sex marriage. Indeed, it’s hard to trace much public political advancement before the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City’s Greenwich Village. This movement has snowballed at a dizzying pace.
<br><br>
As a straight, ideologically middle-of-the-road, white male, born in the South in the early 1950s, I had little predisposition to support same-sex marriage. For most of my life, until the 1990s, Ii didn’t really think much about it. My feelings were characterized more by ambivalence than skepticism. The issue didn’t seem
terribly relevant to me, a feeling that was probably pretty commonplace at that time.
<br><br>
My personal odyssey on gay rights started in 1998 when I offered a job to a woman I had met a few months earlier. She was the political director for a major national advocacy group. The woman was smart, highly professional, and impressive. I didn’t have any idea about her sexual orientation. It certainly wasn’t an issue for me. I just never thought about it. Before she accepted the offer, she met with my two female coworkers and asked, “Would it matter to Charlie that I am gay?” They replied that it wouldn’t be an issue.
<br><br>
She came to work with us and became not just a colleague but also a close friend. And, like many semi-clueless straight guys, I also came to learn a lot about the challenges facing gay people, even those who live in urban areas and have supportive bosses. In 1999, I went to a commitment ceremony, my first, for her and her partner on the Eastern Shore. At that time, not only were they unable to be legally united, but I couldn’t put her partner on our company health care plan – even if I paid for it. This wasn’t just an issue of fairness; it also put small businesses like <em>The Cook Political Report</em> at a competitive disadvantage. It was easy to understand why business got far ahead of politicians on this issue.
<br><br>
Last year, this couple had a long overdue – and legal – wedding in the District of Columbia. Political operatives in both parties and journalists from every major news organization in town attended. Everything was as normal as any other wedding. Her spouse is also now fully covered by our health care plan.
<br><br>
To me, one of the keys to this gigantic change in public attitudes is role models. As more and more straight Americans came to be aware of, and got to know, gay couples – homeowners, many in longtime, committed relationships, and parents living as “normal” a life as anyone else – it just began to seem not different. It was no longer so unusual, so “unnatural” or, for some, so threatening. And in every region; in conservative, moderate, and liberal families; among Democrats and Republicans; across all economic, social and racial lines, it just started to be more common. A national conservative activist recently told me of visiting campus chapters of an extremely conservative organization in a Southern state, and asking students about same-sex marriage. None seemed to have a problem with it. Recently, a very high-level GOP operative confided that he couldn’t think of a national race where he would use the gay-marriage issue against a Democrat. That’s an amazing departure from just 10 years ago, when the issue was used as a powerful political wedge.
<br><br>
My kids grew up with this coworker friend and her partner, who came to our house for cookouts, birthdays, and office parties, and I don’t remember ever having any conversation with them about it – or about the gay couple living next door (who are far better neighbors than their predecessors). Years later, when one of our sons told me of participating in a class debate on same-sex marriage, with some trepidation I asked him which side he took (you never know about teenage boys). He replied indignantly, “For it, of course,” offended that I would even think he might not be. I smiled to myself, thinking, <em>We raised him right</em>. To our children, having gay friends was no different than having African-American, Latino, Asian, left- handed, short, or tall friends. It just didn’t matter. I rather doubt that my late parents or grandparents would have had quite that same view.
<br><br>
In my opinion, what has happened is attitudinal change based on generations and personal life experiences. Almost every family has a son or daughter, niece, nephew, cousin, next-door neighbor, coworker, or classmate who is gay, and most likely quite a few at that. We’ve come to think it’s as normal as anything else. Because it is.

                                 12% of Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its work. This is slightly higher than the all-time Gallup low of 9% in October 2013. The high point of the last 16 months was15% approval in late 2012. Approval by Republicans is at 23%, but among Democrats it is 7%.
<br><br>
Of perhaps greater import, the percentage of Americans who think their Member of Congress deserves re-election (46%) has fallen to a new low. The high point in the last 22 years was 69% in 1998. Furthermore, the percentage of Americans who think that most Members of Congress deserve re-election (17%) has also fallen to an all-time low.
<br><br>
42% say they will vote for the Republican candidate in their Congressional district, while 39% say they will vote for the Democratic candidate. [NYT/CBS]
<br><br>
Much is being made of late of the number of Members of the Senate and the House who so far this cycle have announced their retirement or are otherwise leaving one body or the other. The latest is John Dingell (D-MI), the longest serving member of either body, who announced his retirement earlier this week.
<br><br>
The reality is that there is nothing unusual about the number of departures, at least so far. The chart that follows shows why Members depart. For example, so far in the 113th Congress, 12 of the 45 House Members who have announced their retirement are doing do to run for other office – 12 for the Senate.

In fact, the number of departures in the 111th (128) and the number of departures in the 112th (106), well exceed the number that are likely to depart in the 113th.

Party control of the U.S. Senate is in play. Of the 55 current Democratic seats, including two independents, three seats will switch unless something extraordinary occurs, Montana, West Virginia, and South Dakota.
<br><br>
There are 7 Toss-Up seats, 5 of which are currently held by Democrats and 2 by Republicans. If the Republicans hold on to their 2 Toss-Up seats they need to pick up 3 of the Democratic seats to gain control or 2 to guarantee that V.P Biden will be spending a lot of time in the Senate.
<br><br>
Of the two Republican toss-up seats, a Republican observer, in whom I have great confidence, said he was confident that McConnell will pull it out, “he will bring a gun to a knife fight.”

During January 20-23, 2014, the ABC/WP survey found Clinton leading Christie 53% to 41%. (This survey came after the Bridge fiasco bit Christie. Christie’s favorability rating had fallen from 52% in June 2013 to 35% in this survey.)

Obama’s approval among Hispanics has dropped from 75% to 52% over the last year. [Gallup 12/13]
<br><br>
On not a single one of the following personal characteristics does Obama have a positive score: strong leader (48%); understands problems of people like you (47%); is honest and trustworthy (49%). His positive rating on the latter characteristic has only been lower in November 2013, when 47% had a positive view.
<br><br>
And, on specific policy areas his approval rating is well into negative territory.

There is a considerable hue and cry in some quarters about Obama’s announcement that, if the Congress is going to continue to do little or nothing, he intends to use his Executive Orders to get as much done as he can.
<br><br>
At least through the first five years of his tenure as President, Obama trails substantially the most recent two-term Presidents before him in the number of Executive Orders issued.

The President (as well as Democrats in the Congress) continues to be burdened by the reality that at no time since the Affordable Care Act (more generally known as Barack Obama’s health care plan or Obama Care) was passed have there been more Americans who thought it was a “totally good idea” than thought it was a “totally bad idea.”

<br><br>
In December 2013, the number who thought it was a “totally bad idea” hit a new high, when 50% expressed that view. At the same time 34% said it was a “totally good idea.” In January, “totally bad” topped “totally good” by 48% to 34%. [NBC/WSJ 1/14]

The official unemployment rate for January 2014 is 6.6%. However, the real unemployment rate is 12.7%. The latter number includes the so-called “marginally attached” plus those who are working part-time, but would like to be working full time. This is, of course, a substantial change from January 2010, when the unemployment rate was 9.8% and the real unemployment rate was 16.7%.

In the CNN/ORG poll, 36% rate economic conditions in the country as good, while 64% describe them as poor. While these are not great numbers, they are substantially better than they were when Obama took office in March 2009, when 13% described conditions as good, while 89% described them as bad.

Americans were asked whether the current economy “works well” or “does not work” for them and their families and various other groupings. Of the five groupings tested, the economy is seen as working well for “the wealthy” and for “men.”
<br><br>
The most dramatic schism is the difference in how the economy is seen as working for women and how it is seen as working for men. Women are considered to be behind men:
