The public’s grade for the job President Obama is doing (as found by Gallup 2/19-21/14) is 44% approval/51% disapproval. Of the 5 most recent, two-term Presidents at this point in their second term, Obama’s current approval rating is better than George Bush II and Richard Nixon. The list of 6 follows:

Obama’s approval among Hispanics has dropped from 75% to 52% over the last year. [Gallup 12/13]
<br><br>
On not a single one of the following personal characteristics does Obama have a positive score: strong leader (48%); understands problems of people like you (47%); is honest and trustworthy (49%). His positive rating on the latter characteristic has only been lower in November 2013, when 47% had a positive view.
<br><br>
And, on specific policy areas his approval rating is well into negative territory.

59% of Americans say they are disappointed with the Obama Presidency “so far.” 40% are satisfied. [NYT/CBS 2/14]

There is a considerable hue and cry in some quarters about Obama’s announcement that, if the Congress is going to continue to do little or nothing, he intends to use his Executive Orders to get as much done as he can.
<br><br>
At least through the first five years of his tenure as President, Obama trails substantially the most recent two-term Presidents before him in the number of Executive Orders issued.

The President (as well as Democrats in the Congress) continues to be burdened by the reality that at no time since the Affordable Care Act (more generally known as Barack Obama’s health care plan or Obama Care) was passed have there been more Americans who thought it was a “totally good idea” than thought it was a “totally bad idea.”

<br><br>
In December 2013, the number who thought it was a “totally bad idea” hit a new high, when 50% expressed that view. At the same time 34% said it was a “totally good idea.” In January, “totally bad” topped “totally good” by 48% to 34%. [NBC/WSJ 1/14]
