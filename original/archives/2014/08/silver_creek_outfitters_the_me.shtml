<h1>Silver Creek Outfitters</h1>
Ketchum, Idaho</div>The men’s room at this clothing and outdoor equipment store is worth noting and visiting, if you happen to be in the store.
<br><br>
It is in the basement level of the store. Everything, including the ceiling and floor, are wood covered. It is bright and has a fresh feeling to it.
<br><br>
There is a white ceramic commode and a silver metal, circular wash basin in a white marble tile top. This rests on a wooden shelf which is attached to the wall. There is one wooden leg at the near right corner. There are a variety of bottles with spray tops containing various cleansing products. Above the wash basin is a wood-framed mirror.
<br><br>
In one corner there is a two-shelf contraption made of small logs and wood slates on which rest various towels and a closed trash can.
<br><br>
Between the toilet and the washbasin there is a vivid sign that says:
<br><br>
Our toilets are sensitive ...<br>
Please only flush toilet paper<br>
Use the provided trash can for all other waste <br>
Products including<br>
Paper towels, feminine products, garbage etc <br>
Thank you for your cooperation, our <br>
Plumbers appreciate it.
<br><br>
On one wall there is a very large picture of the head of a fish looking as if to bite something.
<br><br>
Reservations are not required.
