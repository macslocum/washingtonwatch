<h1>La Piquette</h1>
3714 Macomb Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20016<br>
202-686-2015 (same as Le Zinc)<br>
<a href="mailto:ubfi@lapiquettedc.com">ubfi@lapiquettedc.com</a></div>Debbie and I were with Florence, Peter, Margo, and Joe on our visit to La Piquette.
<br><br>
This location was previously Bistro Le Zinc, which was reviewed in the <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/03/restaurant_bistro_le_zinc.shtml">March 2013, Watch</a>. The physicality of the restaurant has not changed, so here is how I described the restaurant then:
<br><br>
“The restaurant is fairly narrow. On the main level, as you come in, there are tables of various sizes along the right hand wall and several tables to the left, starting about half way into the restaurant. To the left there is a balcony several steps up where there are additional tables which can be combined into a single table for a large group.
<br><br>
“The men's room is relatively small, but includes a white ceramic commode and a square white ceramic washbasin with rounded corners. The walls are red and the floor is covered with very small mixed tiles.”
<br><br>
There appears to be a slight change in décor. There are two wallboards at the far end of the restaurant. The larger of the two appears to note the specials of the evening, and the smaller, a selection of wines.
<br><br>
There is an outside seating area on a raised porch with large umbrellas.
<br><br>
Debbie, Margo and Florence started with the “Salade Composee” – Lentil du Puy, Beets, Quinoa, Mix Heirloom Tomatoes. Peter started with Chilled Vichyssoise soup – Leeks, Light Cream. Joe opted for Cod Fish “Croquettes Brandade” – Sauce Gribiche, French Fries. I selected Roasted Beets & Grilled Leek Salad – Yogurt, Fresh Mint, Sherry Vinegar, Olive Oil.
<br><br>
For our entrees:
<br><br>
Florence – Grilled Norwegian Salmon – Pomme Puree, Garlic Spinach, Sauce Vierge.
<br><br>
Margo – Mussels Frites – White Wine, Shallot, Garlic, Butter and Parsley.
<br><br>
Debbie – Razor Clams – Linguini, Butter, Parsley, Anise.
<br><br>
Peter – Steak Frites – Entrecote, Tomato Provençale, Green Peppercorn Sauce.
<br><br>
Joe and Mike – Braised Rabbit – Linguini, White Wine, Cream, Basil.
<br><br>
The service was good. The serving person misunderstood what appetizers Debbie, Florence and Margo had ordered, and when he delivered the wrong dish to the table and one of them pointed out the error, he quickly replaced them.
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, particularly given the relatively small size of the restaurant.
<br><br>
Parking is on the street.
<br><br>
Dinner is served Tuesday through Sunday; lunch Tuesday through Friday; and brunch Saturday & Sunday.
