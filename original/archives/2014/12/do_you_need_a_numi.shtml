<p></p>
As regular readers of the Watch know, most of the Watch’s restaurant reviews include comments about the restroom.
<br><br>
This fixation on the quality of the restrooms led Debbie to suggest that she wanted to buy a Numi for me.
<br><br>
The Numi is a rather unusual commode. For openers it has a touch-screen remote control that is somewhat large than an iPod Touch.
<br><br>
Rather than try and describe the Numi myself I have chosen to select certain descriptive material from “The New York Times” in October 2011.
<br><br>
“All the Numi controls are handled through a touch screen remote control that is somewhat larger than an iPod Touch. That remote controls flushing, cleaning, drying, music, heating, and other settings and preferences; combinations of preferences can be stored in user profiles for different family members.”
<br><br>
“The rear panels are translucent, and LED lights gently illuminate the toilet when the Numi’s sensor determines that the room has gone dark. Another LED is mounted in the bowl itself for additional nighttime guidance;...”
<br><br>
“Walk up to the Numi, and a location sensor will detect your presence and cause the toilet’s lid to rise, revealing the rectangular-on-the outside, round-where-it- counts seat. If you are a man standing in front of the toilet, you will notice a blue beam of light projected on the right-side-floor, adjacent to the toilet. Place your foot in the path of that beam and the toilet seat will rise; break the beam again and the toilet will flush and the seat will lower itself.”
<br><br>
“The Numi has what is referred to in the industry as “bidet features;” it can wash and dry its user (there are modes for women and men). Both functions are accomplished via a wand that extends from under the seat that can spray water or blow air.”
<br><br>
“An FM radio and stereo speakers are also built in. Up to three pre-sets can be stored on the remote, which has settings for base, treble and balance.”
<br><br>
I declined Debbie’s sweet offer.
