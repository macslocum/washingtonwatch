In mid-June, the NBC/WSJ poll found that 63% of us think the country is on the wrong track. This is about the same as has been found each month since December, 2013.

The official BLS unemployment rate for May 2014 is 6.3%, unchanged from the previous month. If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full- time work, the rate is 12.2%. This is down from 13.8% a year ago.
<br><br>
In the 3rd week of June, Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.1%. This is down from an average of 7% for the month of May. It also found an underemployment rate (unemployed +those working part-time, but wanting full time) of 16.1%, down from the May average of 16.4%
<br><br>
The long term unemployed are having a hard time getting companies to look at their job applications. There has not been this much long-term unemployment since at least 1948. 35% of unemployed people have been out of work for at least six months . [WP 5/14]

Another way to measure employment is by examining the employment- population ratio. This is a measurement of employed people as a percentage of the entire civilian, non-institutional population. That ratio has stayed roughly the same since September 2009.

“The income gap isn’t as static as we think.”

<li> Overall, the poverty rate increased by nearly 12% between 1970 and 2010, from 13.7% to 15.3%
<br><br>
<li> The percentage of children ages 3 and 4 enrolled in preschool increased almost four-fold nationwide between 1970 and 2010.

<li> 78% of students graduated high school on time in 1970, and 78.2% graduated on time in 2010.

<li>  The share of adults with at least an associate’s degree saw an increase of 105% from 1970 to 2010 nation-wide.

<li>  The proportion of youth (ages 16-24) not in school and not working dropped by 4%, from nearly one in five (18.8%) in 1970 to 14.7% in 2010.
<br><br>
<li>  The total violent crime rate increased about 10% from 1970 to 2010, but this was due to a doubling of the violent crime rate between 1970 to 1990; from 1990-2010 the rate fell.
<br><br>
<li>  The number of medical doctors (per 100,000 population) increased from 137.2 per 100,000 in 1970 to 265.9 per 100,000 in 2010.

22% of Americans have positive feelings about the Tea Party Movement. This is only 1 point higher than the all-time low on this question, in October 2013. 40% think the Tea Party has too much influence on the Republican party, while 20% think it does not have enough influence. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]
<br><br>
48% of Republican agreed with the Tea Party in 2010. Today that number is 33%. The number of Republicans who specifically disagree with the Tea Party has grown over that time period from 3% to 11%. [Pew Research Center 5/14]
<br><br>
In a column on June 12, 2014 in the “Washington Post,” Dan Balz makes the following point about the current tumult in the Republican Party.
<br><br>
Balz writes that the GOP is split in a number of ways. There is an establishment wing, which might also be called the business wing. There is the Tea Party wing, which might better be called the populist, conservative, grass-roots insurgency. There is a House wing and a Senate wing, and soon there will be a Presidential wing.
<br><br>
The following is a picture of the ideological makeup of the Congressional electorate from 1984 – 2012, prepared by David Winston and Myra Miller of The Winston Group.
<br><br>
There has been little change in the percentage of conservatives. Liberals have grown from 17% to 25% of the electorate, and Moderates have dropped from 47% to 40%.

Americans have been losing their taste for milk. In 1970, average consumption per American was 1.5 cups a day. Now it is roughly 0.8 cups per day.
<br><br>

The decline has affected all kinds of milk, but consumption of whole milk has tumbled the most, down 78% since 1970. The greatest declines “are in the 2- 11 and 12-19 age groups.” It seems that the widely acclaimed health benefits of milk have been challenged, along with the increased availability of an ever- growing variety of other drinks. [WP 6/21/14]
