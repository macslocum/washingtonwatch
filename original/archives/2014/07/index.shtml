<h1>Restaurant Oker</h1>
Den newer 17<br>
Den Hague, (Holland) Netherlands</div><em>Debbie and Rachel went biking in Holland and Belgium. The following review is written by Debbie.</em>
<br><br>
This hip restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel, the Des Indes, who made our reservation.
<br><br>
We walked over and were delighted to find contemporary Dutch cuisine in a small restaurant with tables on "stages," giving the restaurant floor lots of different heights and a feeling of spaciousness. The bar was hopping.
<br><br>
Since every meal was delicious and larger than we were used to eating, Rachel and I decided to order three different plates and share.
<br><br>
The waitress insisted we order the bread, which was delicious. We then tried the small plates of Moroccan Eggplant salad with goat cheese, Harissa dressing and cashews; the Thai coconut-lime soup with tiger prawns and shiitake mushrooms; and the pancakes with duck confit, spring onions, scallion and Hoisin sauce.
<br><br>
All the wait staff kept coming over to check on us and to see how we liked the "tastes." We did!
<br><br>
Upon their recommendation, for dessert we ordered their special Tonka Bean ice cream with Almond Caramel Crunch Lukewarm.
<br><br>
Excellent and fun.

<h1>Seasons</h1>
16 Herenstraat<br>
Amsterdam, (Holland) Netherlands</div><em>Debbie and Rachel went biking in Holland and Belgium. The following review is written by Debbie.</em>
<br><br>
The night before Rachel and I started our bike trip in Holland, we were in Amsterdam and seeking a farm-to-table restaurant...we found it in Seasons.
<br><br>
Seasons is a long, narrow restaurant with 14 two tops and 4 four tops. We were lucky to be seated near the front and could look out on our first sunny evening and watch numbers of people, who did not have reservations, be turned away.
<br><br>
The menu was diverse and fun. It was designed to be a three course meal, but you could demur. We did not.
<br><br>
The waitress brought a jar of olives and delicious bread with our drinks. Debbie chose as a starter a divine asparagus, goat cheese and sweet onion tart with a pomegranate dressing. Rachel started with oak-smoked chicken, mango and coriander salad.
<br><br>
For the main course, Debbie chose spicy garlic shrimp on stir-fried noodles with a salad of avocado, orange and cilantro. Yummy and beautiful. Rachel had the Chicken Tikki Masala with Naan, condiments. It was among the best Tikki Masalas either of us had tasted and we noticed that many of our fellow diners also ordered it.
<br><br>
Dessert! Rachel ordered the Dutch Stroopwafel with vanilla ice cream and caramel. A stroopwafel, we learned, is a waffle-pressed thin cookie and was crumbled into the ice cream. Debbie tried the New Orleans Bananas Foster, a Dutch take on a favorite dish.
<br><br>
Rachel described the restroom as small, but serviceable.
<br><br>
This restaurant was our favorite in Amsterdam and looked to be a very popular local favorite too.

Washington, DC<br>

<a href="mailto:info@theredhendc.com">info@theredhendc.com</a></div>Debbie, Maxine and I went to The Red Hen, having heard a number of positive reports about this relatively new restaurant.
<br><br>
There is nothing but a small sign with a red hen hanging near the front door to let you know you are at the right place. As you enter the restaurant the reception desk is on your left.
<br><br>
The restaurant is a large square. It is cavernous, with large beams and posts and brick walls. It has an instantly comfortable feel.

At the far end, off the square, is an open kitchen. At the center, backing up to the kitchen, is a very large "U" shaped bar with 6 high stools on each of the three sides. Dinner can be eaten at the bar. The night we were there, every seat was filled, and there were a number of folks with drinks in their hands, waiting to grab a seat as they opened.
<br><br>
Wrapped around the bar are a large number of heavy wood tables seating parties of 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8. The chairs are also of heavy wood and not the most comfortable.
<br><br>
Table water is served in what appear to be empty wine bottles, sans labels.
<br><br>
The night we were there the menu had 10 starters, 5 pasta and grain dishes, 4 large plates, 2 extras, and 6 desserts.
<br><br>
Maxine decided to order three starters. First she had a Chilled Tomato Soup with Toasted Almonds, Cucumber and Ricotta Salata. This was followed by Little Gem Lettuces with Snow Peas, Cherry Tomatoes, Hazelnuts & Goddess Dressing. For her “entrée” she chose Citrus Cured King Salmon with Horseradish Cream, Capers, Dill & Crispy Potatoes.
<br><br>
Debbie started with the Little Gem Lettuces, followed by Caramelized Scallops with Fregola, English Peas, Pancetta & Littleneck Clams.
<br><br>
I started with Charred Beef Tongue with Root Vegetable Slaw, Mint & Tomato Sauce. For my main course I selected Wood-Grilled Chicken ‘Fra Diavolo’ with Kale, Fingerling Potatoes, Currants & Preserved Lemon. (Ordinarily I do not comment on particular dishes, but this to my memory is the best chicken I have ever eaten.)
<br><br>
The restaurant is fairly noisy and, as you would expect, the crowd is relatively young.
<br><br>
The service was excellent in timing, helpfulness, friendliness, and attitude.
<br><br>
There are two unisex restrooms. They are small but adequate. The one that I used had a white ceramic washbasin and commode on a solid red wall. There is a gold framed mirror above the washbasin. One side wall is built of red painted bricks “decorated” with drippy white things. The facing wall is also red. There is a small cabinet, topped by a basket filled with an extra toilet paper roll, at the intersection of the brick and plain wall.
<br><br>
The restaurant is only open evenings, and opens at 5:30 p.m. on Monday- Thursday, and 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended and are taken for parties of up to eight.
<br><br>
They claim to keep room for walk-ins. We were able to get a 7pm reservation on a Thursday night about 10 days in advance. I tried getting a 7pm reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, but those times were booked several weeks in advance.
<br><br>
At the time we made our reservations, the restaurant was only accepting reservations by telephone.
<br><br>
Parking is an issue, but there is valet parking on Friday and Saturday night.

                                 Recently WW engaged in a discussion with one of its readers:
<br><br>
WW: Here are the latest performance numbers for Obama.
<br><br>
Reader: What happens when the main stream press stops covering up for Obama in its ongoing coverage?
<br><br>
WW: That part of the press that appears to cover his back won’t change, but their impact is less because there is an increasingly active more conservative press.
<br><br>
Reader: The difference is that the negative, right-wing press reinforces opinion, whereas the mainstream media helps form opinion. Right-wing media only serves those who are looking to reinforce their preconceptions. Mainstream also gets repeated in less ideologically driven periodicals and broadcast. No one repeats stories written in the New York Post, but a story from the Times (NY), “Washington Post,” network news, gets repeated hundreds of times. The impact of the left has much more influence, based on volume of viewers and readers. Combining the effect of the Times and W Post with the viewership of the nightly news plus their repeaters creates an audience millions more than that of the right. It won’t change unless the internet-provided information overcomes Jon Stewart.

Leadership comes in many forms, styles, strengths, weaknesses. The question is whether a leader with particular strengths and weaknesses works in a particular situation.

There is nothing particularly exciting to report in the contest for control of the House of Representatives. Republicans will maintain control. Based on the number of current Democratic seats in the Toss-Up column, it is possible, if not likely, that Republicans will add to their majority. (Cook Political Report is my bible here.)

<h2>2016</h2>

Since the last edition of the Watch (mid-May) six Democrats and two Republicans have been added to the list of people who have said they are thinking about running for President or who have been talked about by others as potential candidates for the top office. The Republicans are Rick Santorum and Rick Perry. The Democrats are Duval Patrick, Brian Schweitzer, Mark Warner, Jay Nixon, Jim Webb, and Bernie Sanders.
<br><br>
On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton remains the one person who clears the field if she decides to run. The only interesting note is that Elizabeth Warren, who a couple of months ago was adamant that she is not contemplating a run for President in 2016, refused to commit herself to that position last month.
<br><br>
On the Republican side there is no such figure.

Clinton caused a certain flurry over the last several weeks based on her answers to questions relating to the family wealth. Her detractors have begun arguing that, given her wealth and other circumstances, she cannot “relate to or understand the problems of average Americans” as well as other Presidential candidates might.
<br><br>
In a survey conducted in late June, 55% said she could relate as well as other candidates while 37% took the opposite view. The responses of men and women were relatively the same with a few more men saying she could not relate as well. Independents split 46% yes and 44% no on the question.

                                 Public confidence in the Congress has hit a new low, with only 7% expressing a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the Congress. The high point in the last decade was 19% in 2006. This 7% confidence figure compares to confidence of 74% in the military, 53% in the police, 30% in the Supreme Court, and 29% in the Presidency. [Gallup 6/14]
<br><br>
14% approve of the way that Congress is handling its job, 78% disapprove. [NYT/CBS 6/14] In June, surveys conducted by Fox, Gallup, and CBS/NYT show that approval of the job being done by Congress ranges from 13-16% approval. Three surveys taken by The Economist/YouGov during the month averaged 9.3% approval.
<br><br>
36% of Americans would prefer that separate Parties control the House and the Senate, while 32% prefer single Party control. Roughly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans prefer one Party control of both Houses. But only 27% of Independents would make that choice. [Gallup 6/14]
<br><br>
Among registered voters, 45% say they will vote for the Democratic candidate and 43% for the Republican candidate. [NBC/WSJ 6/14] In the NYT/CBS 6/14 survey, 42% say they will vote Democratic and 39% Republican.
<br><br>
Only 32% of registered voters think their current representative deserves to be re-elected. 57% take the opposite view. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]
<br><br>
Given a choice between an Independent/3rd party candidate, a Democrat, and a Republican when they cast their vote for their Member of the House of Representatives, 27% would go Independent, 35% Democratic, and 30% Republican. These are about the same results as were found last October, and in the summer and fall of 2010. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]
<br><br>
Among registered voters 24% say that their vote for a Congressional candidate will be a message that they support Obama, while 34% say they will be sending a message that they oppose Obama. 41% say their vote is not a signal either way. [NBC/WSJ 6/14] A survey conducted by NBC/WSJ/Annenberg Public Policy Center during the 2nd week in June, asking essentially the same question, found 23% saying their vote was in support of Obama and 36% saying their vote was against Obama.

<h2>The Senate</h2>

There continue to be 9 Toss-Up seats in the Senate, 7 of which are currently held by Democrats and 2 by Republicans. “Conventional wisdom” continues to tell us that the Republicans will hold their 2 Toss-Up seats, and that South Dakota, Montana, and West Virginia, all currently held by Democrats, will switch. Thus, to achieve control, the Republicans need only pickup 3 of the 7 Democratic Toss- up States.
<br><br>
Iowa, which was pretty much seen as heading for continued control by a Democrat, is showing signs of being quite competitive. Bruce Braley (D) was leading Joni Ernst by 13 points in March, when there was still a Republican primary contest in bloom. Now, in mid-June, Braley leads Ernst by 4 points.
<br><br>
Among the Democratic Toss-ups, Arkansas, which was seen to be leaning towards a Republican take-over seems to have leveled out. Pryor is a long way from having a lock on re-election however. On the other hand, Begich’s position in Alaska seems to have improved. And Udall (D) seems to be doing better in Colorado.
<br><br>
Recent publicly available polling in the Kentucky race (all from pollsters in whom WW does not have much faith) shows Grimes with a chance against McConnell. But it is hard to believe that, at the end of the day, McConnell will lose.
<br><br>
As for Georgia, it will be hard to get a real read until the July 22nd Republican primary runoff is completed. In general, Nunn seems to be holding her own.

In thinking about the 2014 races it is hard not to think about the run-off between Thad Cochran and Chris McDaniel. While most everyone has given the race to Cochran, McDaniel has not conceded and is in the process of trying to identify voters who participated in the Democratic primary and then also voted in the Republican runoff.
<br><br>
McDaniel has also complained about people who are not Republicans voting in the Republican primary. In that regard he may have led the way. It is reported that McDaniel voted in the Democratic primary in 2003 and he certainly was not a Democrat.
<br><br>
It appears that Cochran’s margin of victory (some 7,000 votes) resulted from an effective courtship of African American voters who had not participated in the Democratic primary but who had supported him in the past.

<h2>Pick Your Method</h2>

Vox.com had an interesting piece by Andrew Prokop on May 28th. He states and then explains that the “New York Times” was predicting a 58% chance that the Democrats would retain their majority in the Senate, while at the same time the “Washington Post” wrote that the Republicans had a 77% chance of taking control of the Senate. How the two organizations approach their prognostications, the “NYT” with considerable use of polls and the “Washington Post” with no current use of polls, is worth a read.

Of the 6 most recent, two-term Presidents at this point in their second term, Obama’s current approval rating continues to be better than George Bush II and Richard Nixon. He trails Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Dwight Eisenhower. The list of 6 follows:

Again in mid-June, Obama’s unfavorable rating hit a new low of 52% . [Gallup]
<br><br>
When it comes to how Americans “feel” about Obama, 45% say they have negative feelings and only 41% have positive feelings. This is the worst score he has had on this question during his tenure in office. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]
<br><br>
54% say that Obama cannot lead the country and get the job done.
<br><br>
54% disapprove of the way Obama has handled the economy. His worst score on the economy was in December 2013, at 58% disapproval. On his handling of foreign policy, disapproval hit 57%, the worst score of his term in office.
<br><br>
The country is split 50% to 50% on whether the Obama Administration is competent and effective. As recently as June 2013, 57% found the Administration as competent and 43% said it was not competent. 41% think the performance of the Administration has gotten worse over the last 12 months, while 15% think it has gotten better. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]
<br><br>
On his handling of immigration, Obama has gone from substantial disapproval to a 50/50 split on the question, and now back to a new disapproval high.

The official BLS unemployment rate for May 2014 is 6.3%, unchanged from the previous month. If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full- time work, the rate is 12.2%. This is down from 13.8% a year ago.

In the 3rd week of June, Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.1%. This is down from an average of 7% for the month of May. It also found an underemployment rate (unemployed +those working part-time, but wanting full time) of 16.1%, down from the May average of 16.4%
<br><br>
The long term unemployed are having a hard time getting companies to look at their job applications. There has not been this much long-term unemployment since at least 1948. 35% of unemployed people have been out of work for at least six months . [WP 5/14]

22% of Americans have positive feelings about the Tea Party Movement. This is only 1 point higher than the all-time low on this question, in October 2013. 40% think the Tea Party has too much influence on the Republican party, while 20% think it does not have enough influence. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]

48% of Republican agreed with the Tea Party in 2010. Today that number is 33%. The number of Republicans who specifically disagree with the Tea Party has grown over that time period from 3% to 11%. [Pew Research Center 5/14]
<br><br>
In a column on June 12, 2014 in the “Washington Post,” Dan Balz makes the following point about the current tumult in the Republican Party.
<br><br>
Balz writes that the GOP is split in a number of ways. There is an establishment wing, which might also be called the business wing. There is the Tea Party wing, which might better be called the populist, conservative, grass-roots insurgency. There is a House wing and a Senate wing, and soon there will be a Presidential wing.

The following is a picture of the ideological makeup of the Congressional electorate from 1984 – 2012, prepared by David Winston and Myra Miller of The Winston Group.

There has been little change in the percentage of conservatives. Liberals have grown from 17% to 25% of the electorate, and Moderates have dropped from 47% to 40%.

Americans have been losing their taste for milk. In 1970, average consumption per American was 1.5 cups a day. Now it is roughly 0.8 cups per day.
<br><br>

The decline has affected all kinds of milk, but consumption of whole milk has tumbled the most, down 78% since 1970. The greatest declines “are in the 2- 11 and 12-19 age groups.” It seems that the widely acclaimed health benefits of milk have been challenged, along with the increased availability of an ever- growing variety of other drinks.
