<h1>The Red Hen</h1>
1822 First St. NW<br>
Washington, DC<br>
202-525-3021<br>
<a href="mailto:info@theredhendc.com">info@theredhendc.com</a></div>Debbie, Maxine and I went to The Red Hen, having heard a number of positive reports about this relatively new restaurant.
<br><br>
There is nothing but a small sign with a red hen hanging near the front door to let you know you are at the right place. As you enter the restaurant the reception desk is on your left.
<br><br>
The restaurant is a large square. It is cavernous, with large beams and posts and brick walls. It has an instantly comfortable feel.
<br><br>
At the far end, off the square, is an open kitchen. At the center, backing up to the kitchen, is a very large "U" shaped bar with 6 high stools on each of the three sides. Dinner can be eaten at the bar. The night we were there, every seat was filled, and there were a number of folks with drinks in their hands, waiting to grab a seat as they opened.
<br><br>
Wrapped around the bar are a large number of heavy wood tables seating parties of 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8. The chairs are also of heavy wood and not the most comfortable.
<br><br>
Table water is served in what appear to be empty wine bottles, sans labels.
<br><br>
The night we were there the menu had 10 starters, 5 pasta and grain dishes, 4 large plates, 2 extras, and 6 desserts.
<br><br>
Maxine decided to order three starters. First she had a Chilled Tomato Soup with Toasted Almonds, Cucumber and Ricotta Salata. This was followed by Little Gem Lettuces with Snow Peas, Cherry Tomatoes, Hazelnuts & Goddess Dressing. For her “entrée” she chose Citrus Cured King Salmon with Horseradish Cream, Capers, Dill & Crispy Potatoes.
<br><br>
Debbie started with the Little Gem Lettuces, followed by Caramelized Scallops with Fregola, English Peas, Pancetta & Littleneck Clams.
<br><br>
I started with Charred Beef Tongue with Root Vegetable Slaw, Mint & Tomato Sauce. For my main course I selected Wood-Grilled Chicken ‘Fra Diavolo’ with Kale, Fingerling Potatoes, Currants & Preserved Lemon. (Ordinarily I do not comment on particular dishes, but this to my memory is the best chicken I have ever eaten.)
<br><br>
The restaurant is fairly noisy and, as you would expect, the crowd is relatively young.
<br><br>
The service was excellent in timing, helpfulness, friendliness, and attitude.
<br><br>
There are two unisex restrooms. They are small but adequate. The one that I used had a white ceramic washbasin and commode on a solid red wall. There is a gold framed mirror above the washbasin. One side wall is built of red painted bricks “decorated” with drippy white things. The facing wall is also red. There is a small cabinet, topped by a basket filled with an extra toilet paper roll, at the intersection of the brick and plain wall.
<br><br>
The restaurant is only open evenings, and opens at 5:30 p.m. on Monday- Thursday, and 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended and are taken for parties of up to eight.
<br><br>
They claim to keep room for walk-ins. We were able to get a 7pm reservation on a Thursday night about 10 days in advance. I tried getting a 7pm reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, but those times were booked several weeks in advance.
<br><br>
At the time we made our reservations, the restaurant was only accepting reservations by telephone.
<br><br>
Parking is an issue, but there is valet parking on Friday and Saturday night.
