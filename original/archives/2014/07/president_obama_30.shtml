<p></p>
The public’s grade on the job President Obama is doing (as found by Gallup 6/26-28/14) is 43% approval/51% disapproval. In mid-June his approval rating was at 41%, just a point higher than his all-time low of 40% in mid-January.
<br><br>
Of the 6 most recent, two-term Presidents at this point in their second term, Obama’s current approval rating continues to be better than George Bush II and Richard Nixon. He trails Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Dwight Eisenhower. The list of 6 follows:

Again in mid-June, Obama’s unfavorable rating hit a new low of 52% . [Gallup]
<br><br>
When it comes to how Americans “feel” about Obama, 45% say they have negative feelings and only 41% have positive feelings. This is the worst score he has had on this question during his tenure in office. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]
<br><br>
54% say that Obama cannot lead the country and get the job done.
<br><br>
54% disapprove of the way Obama has handled the economy. His worst score on the economy was in December 2013, at 58% disapproval. On his handling of foreign policy, disapproval hit 57%, the worst score of his term in office.
<br><br>
The country is split 50% to 50% on whether the Obama Administration is competent and effective. As recently as June 2013, 57% found the Administration as competent and 43% said it was not competent. 41% think the performance of the Administration has gotten worse over the last 12 months, while 15% think it has gotten better.

On his handling of immigration, Obama has gone from substantial disapproval to a 50/50 split on the question, and now back to a new disapproval high.
