Den Hague, (Holland) Netherlands</div><em>Debbie and Rachel went biking in Holland and Belgium. The following review is written by Debbie.</em>
<br><br>
This hip restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel, the Des Indes, who made our reservation.
<br><br>
We walked over and were delighted to find contemporary Dutch cuisine in a small restaurant with tables on "stages," giving the restaurant floor lots of different heights and a feeling of spaciousness. The bar was hopping.
<br><br>
Since every meal was delicious and larger than we were used to eating, Rachel and I decided to order three different plates and share.
<br><br>
The waitress insisted we order the bread, which was delicious. We then tried the small plates of Moroccan Eggplant salad with goat cheese, Harissa dressing and cashews; the Thai coconut-lime soup with tiger prawns and shiitake mushrooms; and the pancakes with duck confit, spring onions, scallion and Hoisin sauce.
<br><br>
All the wait staff kept coming over to check on us and to see how we liked the "tastes." We did!
<br><br>
Upon their recommendation, for dessert we ordered their special Tonka Bean ice cream with Almond Caramel Crunch Lukewarm.
<br><br>
Excellent and fun.
