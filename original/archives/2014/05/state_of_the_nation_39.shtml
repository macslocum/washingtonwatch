In the fourth week of April, the NBC/WSJ poll found that 63% of us think the country is on the wrong track. In April 2013, 61% held that view. The ABC/WP survey taken at the same time found that 66% believed the country was on the wrong track. In May 2013, 57% held that view.

The official BLS unemployment rate for April 2014 is 6.3%, down from 7.5% one year ago. While this is evidence of an improving employment situation, it may not be as positive as it appears. 800,000 additional people dropped out of the work force and the participation rate is 62.8%, down from 64% a year ago.
<br><br>
In early May, Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.9%, down from 7.4% a year ago. It also found an underemployment rate (unemployed +those working part-time, but wanting full time) of 16.1%

By 40% to 34% the Democratic Party is trusted to do a better job than the Republican Party in dealing with the main problems the nation faces over the next few years.
<br><br>
When asked which political party is most trusted to deal with a series of specific problems, the Democrats led on every issue except dealing with the Federal budget deficit. The most dramatic space between the two parties is the Democratic advantage in dealing with “issues that are especially important to women.”
