<h1>Bagels Etc. and Carry Out</h1>
2122 P Street NW<br>
Washington DC 20037<br>
202-466-7171<br>
Fax 202-466-7961<br>
<a href="http://bagelsetc.net/">www.bagelsetc.net</a></div>This primarily take-out "restaurant" has been at this location for 29 years. I have partaken of its offerings for 25 years.
<br><br>
The restaurant is 8-10 feet wide and quite long. To your left as you enter is a long counter and exhibit cases that enclose the food preparation area. Take a moment to observe and you will see some of the fastest short-order cooking you have ever seen.
<br><br>
Then there is a floor to ceiling wall that blocks the baking area from view.
<br><br>
They advertise 23 kinds of fresh bagels. And they have something they call a “bialy,” which is what I order. For those who are used to New York deli bialys, this bialy bears little resemblance. It is round, 6 inches across, not as thick as a bagel, and weighs 6 to 7 ounces.
<br><br>
There are 14 breakfast specials, ranging from scrambled eggs, to bagel and a choice of meats, to pancakes, two eggs with meat. 11 cold sandwiches; 11 different spreads for bagels; 20 hot sandwiches; 5 bagel melts; 5 pizza bagels; 8 items titled your favorites, ranging from a combo special including roast beef, ham, turkey, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo; 7 cream cheese spreads and a lox spread in 8 oz. containers; 6 salads; 5 homemade soups. And, of course, there are a variety of coffees and soft drinks. The bagels are $1 each or $9.99/dozen.
<br><br>
If you want to sit down and enjoy your selections, there 12 seats outside, 6 seats just inside the front door, and a dozen or more high stools and tables in the back. I have never seen anyone back there, but I have never been there at lunch time.
<br><br>
The restaurant opens at 6 a.m. seven days a week, and closes at 5 p.m. Monday thru Friday, 4 p.m. on Saturday, and 3 p.m. on Sunday.
<br><br>
Parking is problematic. I usually stop before 7 a.m. so there is parking on the street.
