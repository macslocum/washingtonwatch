In early September the NBC/WSJ poll found that 67% of us think the country is on the wrong track. At mid-month, the CBS/NYT survey found 66% saying the country is on the wrong track.
<br><br>
76% are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States. 23% are satisfied. [Gallup 9/14]

As of 2010, “One in four women (24.3%) and one in seven men (13.8%) age 18 and older in the United States have been the victims of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.” (Black et al, 2011)
<br><br>
13,079 U.S. women experience domestic violence every day, and nearly 1 in 3 women have been physically abused. [Time 9/22/14]

The official BLS unemployment rate for August 2014 is 6.1%, down a point from the previous month, and down 1% point from a year ago. If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the rate is 12 %. This is down from 13.6% a year ago. 2.9% of the work force has been unemployed for 15 weeks or more.
<br><br>
In the fourth week of September, Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.8%. It also found an underemployment rate (unemployed +those working part- time, but wanting full time) of 15.4%, up a touch from mid-August.
<br><br>
Indications are that, over the past year, unemployment rates dropped for various groups within the community between August 2013 to August 2014, although for several groups there was a slight uptick from July to August 2014.
<br><br>
Unemployment among those 25 years and older:

Inversions are the topic du jour in Washington. The Winston Group asked respondents what they would do if they had the option to legally file their income taxes in a State with a lower rate or to continue to pay a higher rate in their home State. By 53% to 43% respondents opted to file in the State with lower rates. Among Republicans, 59% would opt to pay in the lower rate State and 51% of Independents would do the same. Only among Democrats would a slight majority, 49% to 48%, opt to continue to pay the higher rate in their home State.

Currently, trust in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government is at 43%. The lowest recorded, 40%, occurred a few months before Richard Nixon resigned. It was also in the low 40s during the last two years of George W. Bush’s Administration.
<br><br>
Trust in the Legislative Branch of the Federal Government is at 28%. Trust in the Judicial Branch of government continues to stand above it all at 61%.
<br><br>
Trust in the American people “to make judgments about political issues facing the country”, at 61%, is also at a new low. Trust in politicians to make these judgments is at 45%, 1% point above the all time low recorded in 2012.

Perhaps it should be no surprise that local government, which on a day-to- day basis is closer to the people, is more trusted than State government. And Americans believe that the Federal Government wastes 51 cents of every dollar. [Gallup 9/14]

While the median income of single parent households (83% of which are headed by women), in 2013 dollars, has grown by +12.4% in 24 years (1989- 2013), that group of households has not yet recovered from the recession which officially ended in 2009. The change in their income from 2010-2013 is still down 11.7%.
