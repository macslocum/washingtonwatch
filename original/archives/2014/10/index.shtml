<a href="http://bagelsetc.net/">www.bagelsetc.net</a></div>This primarily take-out "restaurant" has been at this location for 29 years. I have partaken of its offerings for 25 years.
<br><br>
The restaurant is 8-10 feet wide and quite long. To your left as you enter is a long counter and exhibit cases that enclose the food preparation area. Take a moment to observe and you will see some of the fastest short-order cooking you have ever seen.
<br><br>
Then there is a floor to ceiling wall that blocks the baking area from view.
<br><br>
They advertise 23 kinds of fresh bagels. And they have something they call a “bialy,” which is what I order. For those who are used to New York deli bialys, this bialy bears little resemblance. It is round, 6 inches across, not as thick as a bagel, and weighs 6 to 7 ounces.
<br><br>
There are 14 breakfast specials, ranging from scrambled eggs, to bagel and a choice of meats, to pancakes, two eggs with meat. 11 cold sandwiches; 11 different spreads for bagels; 20 hot sandwiches; 5 bagel melts; 5 pizza bagels; 8 items titled your favorites, ranging from a combo special including roast beef, ham, turkey, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo; 7 cream cheese spreads and a lox spread in 8 oz. containers; 6 salads; 5 homemade soups. And, of course, there are a variety of coffees and soft drinks. The bagels are $1 each or $9.99/dozen.
<br><br>
If you want to sit down and enjoy your selections, there 12 seats outside, 6 seats just inside the front door, and a dozen or more high stools and tables in the back. I have never seen anyone back there, but I have never been there at lunch time.
<br><br>
The restaurant opens at 6 a.m. seven days a week, and closes at 5 p.m. Monday thru Friday, 4 p.m. on Saturday, and 3 p.m. on Sunday.
<br><br>
Parking is problematic. I usually stop before 7 a.m. so there is parking on the street.

                                 For many, many years I have admired Bob Shrum’s ability to write the words used to deliver political messages in all formats, but particularly in speeches. (This is not to undervalue his overall strategic political acumen, which is very high.)
<br><br>
Recently, Bob was installed as the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at USC. During his installation he spoke, and I was particularly taken by a passage from that speech, parts of which I have included below.
<br><br>
“The practice of politics passes through constant revolution. The train brought us the whistle stop. Radio brought immediacy to conventions and campaigns. Then for nearly half a century of TV advertising, the most important political rallies have been two or three people around a television set. That may still be true, but it is one way communication – and now social media are changing that. They are changing the way we organize, talk with, and target the electorate....In the end, social media may prove to be direct mail on steroids.
<br><br>
So while the techniques move on, I believe the decisive role of message endures. ...”

                                 The list of potential candidates for President in 2016 has stabilized, at least for the moment. Hillary Clinton continues to clear the Democratic field. On the Republican side there are six candidates drawing between 11.5% and 8.8%.
<br><br>
In “contests” with seven potential Republican nominees, Clinton averages 49.6%, while the Republicans average 39.7%. Clinton’s spread over the putative Republican nominees ranges from 13.8% over Cruz to 6.7% over Ryan.
<br><br>
The numbers below represent the Real Clear Politics average of public surveys in the respective Party “nomination contests.” In the case of the Democrats from May 29th –July 22nd, and in the case of the Republicans from June 24th –August 4th.

The Watch has not generally covered gubernatorial races and will not do so in any detail, but here is the current state of play based on the Cook Political Report.

There are 36 seats on the ballot this fall. 14 of those seats are held by Democrats and 22 seats are held by Republicans.

The most dramatic exception was Bill Clinton in 1998, when the Democrats did not lose a single seat. (Clinton had overseen the loss of 10 Democratic Senate seats in the 1994 and 1996 elections.)

There have been a number of changes in the status of the U.S. Senate races since the last Watch in August.
<br><br>
In Kansas, the incumbent Pat Roberts (R) is now faced with an unexpected contest. It has been hard to miss the stories about the political and legal machinations that have gone on in this race, so I will not repeat them here. The bottom line is that Roberts is running against an Independent (who used to be a Democrat), Greg Orman. Recent polls, including Fox News, have Orman ahead by 4-6 points. Orman has not said with which side he will caucus, but he could find himself in a situation in which he would decide which Party controls the Senate.
<br><br>
Franken (D-MN) was previously in the Safe Dem column, but the race has become a little closer than expected, and he has been moved to Leaning Dem. Shaheen (D-NH) is still Leaning Dem, but looking a little stronger. Udall (D-CO) and Peters (D-MICH) were previously rated as Toss Ups and are now in the Leaning Dem column.
<br><br>
McConnell (R-KY) and Georgia (R incumbent not running), which were previously in the Toss-Up column, have now moved to Leaning Republican.
<br><br>
Finally, Montana, West Virginia and South Dakota, all with Democratic incumbents who are not running for re-election, should now be considered as Safe Republican.
<br><br>
Louisiana will add a little excitement to election night. The State has no primaries, so if one of the candidates does not get 50% of the vote on November 4th, there will be a runoff of the top two finishers in early December. In Georgia, which did have a primary, if neither candidate draws more than 50% on election night there will be a runoff in January 2015.
<br><br>
There are a variety of opinions as to the impact of a sitting President’s job approval rating on Senate contests in a particular State. Recently, CNN/ORC began a series of State-based polls. In those surveys made public to date, while the President’s job approval rating is 40%, in Iowa it is 37%, in Arkansas it is 33%, in Kentucky it is 29% and in New Hampshire it is 35%.

40% of adult Americans “care a great deal” about who controls Congress. This includes 43% of Republicans and Republican leaners, and an equal number of Democrats and Democratic leaners.
<br><br>
Only 36% of adults can correctly identify which Party controls each of the two houses of the Federal Government. [Gallup 9/14]

Currently, by a margin of 45% to 43%, registered voters prefer a Congress controlled by Republicans as opposed to a Congress controlled by Democrats. A year ago they preferred a Congress controlled by Democrats, 46% to 43%. [NBC/WSJ 9/14]
<br><br>
In a survey conducted three weeks later than the 9/14 NBC/WSJ survey, the NBC/WSJ/Annenberg survey found a shift in public preference for control of the Congress, with 47% preferring Democratic control and 42% preferring Republican control. (Take your pick.)
<br><br>
Women prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats by 47% to 40%, but just over a month ago that preference was 51% to 37%. This is one of several areas in which women’s support of the Democrats is showing signs of slippage. [NBC/WSJ 9/14]
<br><br>
In June of 2014 women felt positively about the Democratic Party by 44%- 36%. That positive feeling has been reduced to 39%-37%. [NBC/WSJ 9/14]
<br><br>
30% of registered voters approve of the way that the Democrats in Congress are handling their job. Only 19% of these voters approve of the way Republicans in Congress are handling their job. [NYT/CBS 9/14]
<br><br>
Overall, the public, by 36% to 26%, thinks the Republican Party would do a better job than the Democratic Party in handling the economy. Women hold the same view by a lesser number, 32% Republicans to 28% Democrats. However, a year ago, when the public at large thought Republicans would do a better job by 33% to 29%, women thought the Democrats would do a better job by 33% to 39%. [NBC/WSJ 9/14]
<br><br>
When it comes to the re-election of the current members of Congress, 87% believe that it is time for new people, and 63% have that view about their own representative in Congress. Both of these results represent the highest number of people who have held that view since this question came into use in the early 1990s. [NYT/CBS 9/14]

In any mid-term election, there is always the question of whether the standing of the President will affect the outcome in individual States. Recent polls in at least four contestable States find the President’s approval rating below his national score. In Iowa it is 37%; in Arkansas it is 33%; in Kentucky it is 29%; and in New Hampshire it is 35%. [CNN/ORC]
<br><br>
Andrew Kohut, founder of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, does not believe that the mid-term elections are a referendum on President Obama’s competence. In his view the “public is unhappy with the performance of both Parties in Washington,” the elections are a referendum on the times, and he believes that the country has a “chronic case of pessimism.” [NYT 8/14]

<br><br>
As voting has been made easier by wider use of no-excuse absentee voting, mail voting, and early voting generally, turnout has gone down.
<br><br>
Prior to 1972, only Tennessee and Idaho offered so-called “no excuse” absentee voting. In all other states if you wanted to vote absentee you needed a reason. In 1972, less than 5 percent of American voters used absentee ballots.
<br><br>
In 1975 Congress enacted the Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act which allowed overseas voting age eligible U.S. citizens without legal domiciles in the United States to vote absentee. Additional legislation in 1986 eased the ability to register.
<br><br>
In 1978, California began absentee voting for anyone by request. By 2010, 40.3% of Californians voted absentee.
<br><br>
In 2008, almost a third (32%) of all voters cast their ballots BEFORE Election Day.
<br><br>
By 2010, including in-person early voting, 30% of voters who cast ballots did not go to the polls on election day. Almost 16% of votes cast were absentee ballots, and nearly 5% more were mail ballots.
<br><br>
For the 2014 General Election:
<br><br>
- 27 States plus the District of Columbia offer no-excuse absentee voting
<br><br>
- North Carolina, Minnesota, Maine, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Vermont all start the week of September 15th-20th
<br><br>
- 33 states and D.C. allow any qualified voter to cast a ballot in person during a designated period prior to Election Day
<br><br>
- Minnesota will become the 27th state to offer no-excuse absentee voting
<br><br>
- Colorado will become the 3rd state to offer all-mail voting for all elections

<strong>The net result of these early voting opportunities is that overall voter turnout has gone down.</strong>
<br><br>
Only mid-term general elections are included in the following analysis.
<br><br>
As you might expect, turnout has gone up in some States and down in others. Results are likely affected by which States have significant contests in a given election. However, those differences do not account for a drop since 1966 of as much as 12% points in certain elections in 1986 and 1998.
<br><br>
In 2010, the turnout was 37.8%, a drop of 10.6% points.
<br><br>
The following is the Voter Turnout Rate for the 1966-2010 mid-term General Elections:

                                 The public’s grade on the job President Obama is doing (as found by Gallup 9/28) is 43% approval/52% disapproval.
<br><br>
In August 2014, the NBC/WSJ survey found women with a disapproval rating of 47% and an approval rating of 46%. In September, that same survey has found with a 52% disapproval rating and a 42% positive rating among women.
<br><br>
Of the five most recent two-term Presidents at this point in their second term, Obama’s current approval rating is essentially tied with George W Bush. He trails Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Dwight Eisenhower. (By this date Richard Nixon had left office.) The list of 5 follows:

53% disapprove of the job Obama is doing in handling the economy, and 62% disapprove of the way he is handling foreign policy. The number disapproving his handling of foreign policy is the highest recorded in the NBC/WSJ survey. This level of disapproval is 13% points higher than it was a year ago (8/14) . The NYT/CBS survey in mid-September showed Obama with a 34% approval rating on foreign policy, which is the lowest finding on this subject in that poll since Obama took office.
<br><br>
Again, when it comes to handling foreign policy, women’s support of Obama has started to fade. In August 2014, 43% approved his handling of foreign policy and 52% disapproved. Now there has been a 10-point drop in women’s support of his handling of foreign policy, with an approval rating of 33% and a disapproval rating of 60%. [NBC/WSJ 9/14]

When President Obama came into office, 99 of the U.S. appellate court judges had been appointed by Republican Presidents and 65 had been appointed by Democratic Presidents.

When it comes to how Americans “feel” about Obama, 46% say they have negative feelings and 42% have positive feelings. A year ago, 45% had positive feelings and 42% had negative feelings. [NBC/WSJ 6/14]

By 55% to 38%, Americans think that Obama has done more to divide the country than to unite it. They also believe that Republicans in Congress have done more to divide than unite the country, by 63% to 27%. [WP/ABC 9/14]
<br><br>
Obama faces a variety of difficult choices as he come to grips with the dangers posed by ISIS (or ISIL if that is your preference). The American public seems to be warming to the task of substantial engagement. 45% of Americans believe that ISIS poses a very serious threat to the United States. Another 23% describe the threat as fairly serious. [CNN/ORC 9/14]
<br><br>
In the early September 2014 NBC/WSJ survey, 34% of Americans were willing to have American airstrikes and combat troops used in this struggle; 40% wanted any action limited to airstrikes. Three weeks later, in the NBC/WSJ Annenberg survey, 45% support air strikes and ground troops, and 72% believe the United States will use ground troops.
<br><br>
75% believe it is at least somewhat likely that the U.S. will eventually send ground troops into combat against ISIS, even though 60% oppose the involvement of U.S. ground troops. [CNN/ORC 9/14]

Conventional wisdom at the moment is that Obama’s Presidency is all but over, and that nothing will happen in the final two years of his tenure. The same case was made at about the same time in the terms of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
<br><br>
In a NYT article, James Mann makes the case that all three of these latter Presidents had significant achievements in the 7th and 8th years of their term. Interestingly, all of the actions mentioned were international in nature. At least at this moment it appears that a significant part of Obama’s focus in the next two years will be the international stage. [NYT 9/22/14]

The official BLS unemployment rate for August 2014 is 6.1%, down a point from the previous month, and down 1% point from a year ago. If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the rate is 12 %. This is down from 13.6% a year ago. 2.9% of the work force has been unemployed for 15 weeks or more.
<br><br>
In the fourth week of September, Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.8%. It also found an underemployment rate (unemployed +those working part- time, but wanting full time) of 15.4%, up a touch from mid-August.
<br><br>
Indications are that, over the past year, unemployment rates dropped for various groups within the community between August 2013 to August 2014, although for several groups there was a slight uptick from July to August 2014.

Inversions are the topic du jour in Washington. The Winston Group asked respondents what they would do if they had the option to legally file their income taxes in a State with a lower rate or to continue to pay a higher rate in their home State. By 53% to 43% respondents opted to file in the State with lower rates. Among Republicans, 59% would opt to pay in the lower rate State and 51% of Independents would do the same. Only among Democrats would a slight majority, 49% to 48%, opt to continue to pay the higher rate in their home State.

The Watch has not generally covered gubernatorial races and will not do so in any detail, but here is the current state of play based on the Cook Political Report.

<br><br>
There are 36 seats on the ballot this fall. 14 of those seats are held by Democrats and 22 seats are held by Republicans.

<br><br>
There are 9 States designated as toss-ups in the chart below.
<br><br>
If the two toss-ups that are leaning Democrat and the four toss-ups that are leaning Republican end up in the direction they are leaning, the Senate count will be
<br><br>
<p align="center">Democrats 47 – Republicans 50</p>
<br><br>
That leaves three toss-ups that are hard to classify as leaning one way or the other. If the seats simply end up with the Party that currently holds them, the final result will be
<br><br>
<p align="center">Democrats 48 – Republicans 52</p>
<br><br>
If the Democrats hold the seat they are currently hold and pickup Georgia or Kansas the result will be
<br><br>
<p align="center">Democrats 49 – Republicans 51</p>
<br><br>
Or, if the Republicans have as big a day as some are predicting, and all of the Toss-ups go Republican the final result could be
<br><br>
<p align="center">Democrats 47 – Republicans 53</p>

Three Democratic Senators, Jeff Merkley (OR), Mark Begich (AK), and Al Franken (MN) were first elected in 2008, defeating Republican incumbents. Each of them won with less than 50% of the vote. Now two of them, Merkley and Franken, seem headed for re-election. Begich is running 2 to 3 points behind in every recent survey. [Trivia provided by Ron Faucheux]

*Independents are included with Democrats in the Senate tallies.

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

14% approve of the way Congress is doing its job. This has been the average approval rating for all of 2014. This is somewhat higher than the 9% approval recorded earlier this year. Democrats tend to be more positive than Republicans. [Gallup]
<br><br>
There is a rather dramatic difference between registered voters and likely voters when it comes to Americans’ preference for the outcome of the 2014 Congressional elections.
<br><br>
In the WP/ABC survey (10/20), 46% of registered voters favor the Democratic candidate, while 44% favor the Republican candidate. However, when it comes to likely voters, 50% favor the Republican candidate and 44% favor the Democratic candidate.
<br><br>
A similar dramatic turn is found in the NBC/WSJ Annenberg survey (10/14) taken at essentially the same time. Registered voters, by 45% to 43%, express a preference for a Republican-controlled Congress. Among likely voters, the preference is for a Republican-controlled Congress by 49% to 44%. And, among an additional category of “high interest” voters, these voters prefer a Republican - controlled Congress by 51% to 41%.
<br><br>
57% of Americans think that in this coming election, rather than re-elect their current representative, it is time to give a new person a chance. 55% would choose a person who is running for the first time over a candidate who had served for at least 10 years. And 55% would vote to replace the entire Congress if such an option was part of the ballot in November. [NBC/WSJ 10/14]. Yet, it is most likely that upwards of 90% of those members seeking re-election will be re- elected.
<br><br>
81% of us believe that most members of Congress are out of touch, but only 47% believe that about their own representative. 54% believe that most members of Congress are corrupt, and about half that number believe that about their own member. [Gallup 10/14]
<br><br>
Among registered voters, 42% are generally negative about the prospect of Republicans controlling the majority in both Houses of the Congress, and 38% are generally positive . However, when it comes to likely voters, “their” position is reversed . 47% of likely voters are positive about the Republicans controlling Congress and 42% are negative. [NBC/WSJ Annenberg 10/14]
<br><br>
The Week 6, NBC/WSJ Annenberg survey reveals that Republicans appear to be “charged up and care,” while Democrats are “fearful and indifferent.” For example, 29% of Republicans see the election as “vital,” 24% see it as “optimistic,” and 44% see it as “important.” Conversely, among Democrats only 20% see it as “vital,” 18% see it as “optimistic,” and 35% see it as important.

At roughly this time before the
<br><br>
- 2006 election, 80% of registered voters said they were following the election very closely;
<br><br>
- 2010 election, 76% of registered voters said they were following the election very closely;
<br><br>
- 2014 election, 68% of registered voters say they are following the election very closely. [WP/ABC 10/26]

The WP/ABC survey found the President’s job approval at 43% up from 40% earlier in the month.

In assessing specific elements of his job performance, it recorded the lowest job approval of his tenure on immigration (29%), international affairs (37%), and the threat of terrorism (42%). His approval scores on implementation of the new health care law (35%) and the economy (44%) have been [ABC/WP 10/14] somewhat lower. [ABC/WP 10/14]

In many ways, President Obama is the “victim” of a confluence of events: in no particular order, they include Israel vs. Hamas; revolution in Syria; the failures of the Iraqi government; ISIS; the Ukraine; the immigration debate/the Border Patrol; the 2014 Congressional and gubernatorial campaigns in which his performance in office has become an issue; Congressional inaction; sequester; continuing revelation of the inadequacy of government contractors; the alleged politicizing of the IRS; the beginning enrollment under the Affordable Care Act; corporate inversions; problems in the Department of Homeland Security; issues with the Secret Service; problems at the Veterans Administration; and finally the Ebola scare and the realization that the CDC is not as prepared as it thought it was; and the intensity of partisanship on both sides.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The question on which everyone has an opinion is whether or not Obama’s lack of popularity will be the cause of anticipated Democratic losses in the Senate and in the House.
<br><br>
The current WP/ABC survey (10/26/14) paints the following picture. The question asked is: “Will/was one reason for your vote for Congress (be) to express (support for) Obama, to express (opposition to) Obama, or is/was Obama not a factor in your choice?”

                                 In the 2nd week of October the NBC/WSJ poll found that 65% of us think the country is on the <strong>wrong</strong> track, while 25% of Americans think the country is on the right track.
<br><br>
Not since June 2013 have more than 30% of Americans thought the country was on the right track. During that same 16 month period the percentage of Americans who think the country is on the <strong>wrong</strong> track has ranged from a high of 78% in October 2013 to a low of 61% in July 2013.

“The lower half of U.S. households, ranked by wealth, held just 1% of total wealth last year (2013) down from 3% in 1989.” [WSJ 10/18 – Janet Yellen]

The official BLS unemployment rate for September 2014 is 5.9 %, down a point from the previous month and down 1.3% points from a year ago. If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the rate is 11.3 %. This is down from 13.1% a year ago. 2.7% of the work force has been unemployed for 15 weeks or more, down from 3.7% a year ago.
<br><br>
In the third week of October Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.3%. It also found an underemployment rate (unemployed +those working part-time, but wanting full time) of 15.0%, down a touch from mid-September.

When asked what they think are the most important issues facing working women in this country today, Americans state that the top four issues are equal pay/fair pay (39%), equal opportunity for promotion (20%), availability of jobs (8%), and more respect in the workplace (8%). On these issues, women, men, and working women all have the same point of view, with the exception that working women rate “equal pay” at 42%, while men rate it at 37%.
<br><br>
However, on three issues which rank further down the list there are real differences.

76% of Americans are dissatisfied with the way this country’s political system is working – or not working – as the case may be. 22% are satisfied.

Support for the Tea Party remains at 24%, down from its high of 32% leading up to the 2010 election. Support fell as low as 21% leading up to the 2012 election. Opposition to the Tea Party has risen to 31%, slightly higher than the previous high. [Gallup 10/14]

<br><br>
35% of us say that the two major Parties do an adequate job. [Gallup 9/14]

Only 40% of us have confidence in the mass media to “accurately, and fairly” report the news. [Gallup 9/14]
<br><br>
Pew Research has surveyed Americans as to whether they trust various news sources about government and politics. The respondents are broken down by their own description of whether they are “consistently liberal, mostly liberal, ideologically mixed, mostly conservative or consistently conservative.”
<br><br>
The chart below reflects the percentage of those who are “consistently liberal,” “consistently conservative,” and “ideologically mixed” who trust the referenced media.
<br><br>
For example, in the case of NPR, 72% of those who are “consistently liberal,” 3% of those who are “consistently conservative,” and 19% of those who are “ideologically mixed” trust NPR.
