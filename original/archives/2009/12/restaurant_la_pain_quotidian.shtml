<h1>La Pain Quotidian</h1>
4874 Massachusetts Ave NW<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>

On the Friday after Thanksgiving I ventured off to the Spring Valley Shopping Center to get my car serviced. As luck would have it, they were able to start working on the car immediately. It was 8:15 a.m. and I needed to kill 45 minutes.
<br><br>
Across Mass Avenue I saw a Starbucks and headed in that direction. But as I crossed the street I found myself in front of a restaurant/bakery I had passed many times before but never tried. And so I did.
<br><br>
It is called La Pain Quotidian.
<br><br>
In terms of the kind food that is served here, it is about as far away from <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/11/restaurant_bens_chili_bowl.shtml">Ben's Chili Bowl</a> as one can get. But in its own way, it is just as good.
<br><br>
The restaurant is V-shaped, with two long walls being floor-to-ceiling glass windows. There are a number of 2- and 4-person tables, and two communal tables, one which holds 30 people, and the other which holds 16.
<br><br>
The tables and chairs are made of plain wood and the chairs are a little on the small side.
<br><br>
I had a small bowl of cut fruit (the fruit is cut into relatively small pieces, making it a whole lot easier to eat than the ordinary size of cut fruit); a small bowl of mixed berries; a bowl of fresh organic granola with skim milk; an egg white omelet with wild mushrooms; a pumpkin muffin (selected by my server as her favorite); hot and cold espresso; and ice tea. [I did not eat all of the foregoing at one time. I tried the restaurant a second time the next morning.]
<br><br>
The breakfast menu includes 6 different omelettes, all of which can be ordered with egg whites. Plain fried eggs are also available. In addition to the Granola there is an offering of organic steelcut oatmeal.
<br><br>
There are a variety of fresh breads and rolls available for consumption during a meal or for take-out from a bakery section.
<br><br>
On my 3rd visit I ordered artine (sandwich) of warm chicken, cheddar cheese and a smatterings of other goodies. It was quite large, and frankly would serve two people if you started with a bowl of soup or a small salad.
<br><br>
The lunch menu includes:
<br><br>
13 Tartines such as grilled chicken, smoked mozzarella, arugula and basil pesto; 8 salads; 4 special platters; and 3 quiches.
<br><br>
There are organic & biogeneric beers and wines on request.
<br><br>
The restaurant offers three meals a day. It is a bit pricey, but overall worth it.
<br><br>
On my first visit there were relatively few people in the restaurant. On Saturday, when I arrived around 10 a.m., it was quite a bit busier. There were many families with small children and it was a bit noisier than my previous visit. On my 3rd visit, late noon on a Friday, there were maybe a dozen people having lunch.
<br><br>
The servers were young, energetic, friendly, and attentive.
<br><br>
The men's room is simple but more than adequate. There is a white ceramic commode and a white ceramic washbasin with a large ornate framed mirror over it. There are small light green tiles up to 6 feet on the walls, and then tan painted walls above that height. The floor is covered with very large tan tiles.
