<p></p>
The state of the current economy is the environment in which the healthcare debate 
is being conducted. 
<br><br>
The average American is "expert" on three broad policy areas: the economy, the 
healthcare system, and the education system, if he or she has, or is responsible for, 
school-aged children.  On each of these subjects, the average American does not rely on 
professional policy experts or elected leaders, whether national or local.  They rely on 
their own experience and knowledge, and that of their neighbors. 
<br><br>
If a person's employment hours are being cut; if their next door neighbor is out of a 
job; if houses in their neighborhood are being foreclosed; then the pronouncements from 
"noted economists," the Federal Reserve, or even the President, stating the recession is 
over or that the economy is improving are not heard; or if heard, are not believed. 
<br><br>
The same is true of healthcare.  If your health insurance does not cover certain 
things or a favorite doctor stops taking insurance or medicare, or drug prescriptions can't 
regularly be filled because they are too expensive for the patient's circumstances, then that 
is the basis on which they judge the healthcare system. 
<br><br>
So as the healthcare debate goes forward, the public's concerns about other 
insecurities in their lives has considerable impact on their reaction to the healthcare 
debate. 

<br>

To further complicate the situation, Americans are saying enough is enough.  For 
the last year and a half, if not longer, they have been besieged with the message that this 
problem, along with others, has to be fixed or "the world as we know it will come to an 
end."  There were stimulus bills, "bailouts," and even the next ice age is just around the 
corner.  They have been told for years that debt is bad, and yet it grows and grows and 
grows.  They know that ultimately the money has to come from them or their children or 
their children's children. 

<br>
<br>

<br>

The Government's efforts to change the current healthcare system has a 
"commander-in-chief, the President.  It has a "chairman of the joint chiefs", the White 
House Chief of Staff.  However, it does not have a "commanding general" to lead the 
effort.  This lack of an Administration leader focused solely on this issue has complicated 
the health care debate. 
<br><br>
The loss of Tom Daschle as the Secretary of HHS and White House healthcare 
czar has had an immeasurable impact on the Administration's efforts.  While the Secretary 
of HHS, Kathleen Sebelius, and the White House health czar are people of quality and 
experience, they do not bring to the effort what Tom Daschle would have brought to the 
table.

Congressional townhall meetings across the country are experiencing record 
crowds.  Is it all about the healthcare bill and are they affecting public opinion generally? 
<br><br>
Anecdotally, the majority of people showing up at these events are not part of 
protesting crowds or groups organized to disrupt.  Rather, these are folks who have real 
concerns about a variety of issues that are currently being dealt with in Washington. 
<br><br>
A recent survey by Gallup (8/09) asked whether the protestors made folks more or 
less sympathetic to their views.  It was a split decision.  34% said they were more 
sympathetic while 21% are less sympathetic.  The rest say they are not affected.

In February 2009 86% said that the economy was the most important problem 
facing the country. 13 months earlier, January 2008, 38% held that view.  During the 
same time period, the number mentioning healthcare had dropped from 13% to about 
10%.  Today, 60% name the economy, while 25% say healthcare.  [Gallup 8/09]

<br>

There are a variety of theories about how the President and the Democratic 
majorities in the House and Senate might be able to pass a substantial healthcare reform 
bill without Republican support. 
<br><br>
A default position that is regularly discussed is the use of the reconciliation 
process.  The advantage of this course is that it is not subject to a filibuster and can pass 
the Senate with 51 votes. 
<br><br>
While passage of the legislation under the reconciliation process places some 
limits on the content of the bill, it appears that enough could be included to make it a 
significant accomplishment.  
<br><br>
It is assumed that Speaker Pelosi will be able to muster the votes to pass in the 
House anything that will clear the Senate. 
<br><br>
By all accounts, the Budget Reconciliation Process has never been used for 
anything of the scope of proposed healthcare legislation.  Its uses have ranged from the 
Tax Equity and Fiscal Responbsility Act of 1982 to the College Cost Reduction and 
Access Act of 2007. 
<br><br>
Some suggest that Republicans in the Senate would be infuriated and would look 
for ways to retaliate procedurally.  They could attempt to slow things down generally or 
hold up judges.  But that is likely to be a short-term problem.  At some stage the 
Republicans are likely to try and slow things down anyway as we get closer to the 2010 
elections. 
<br><br>
The fact is that the Reconciliation Process has been a regular part of Senate 
procedures since it was established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  It was used 
for the first time in 1980 to deal with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980.   It has 
been used 22 times so far...14 times when Republicans controlled the White House and 8 
times when Democrats were in control of the White House.  Reconciliation bills have 
been vetoed 3 times, all by President Clinton.

The following is a summary of a small part of the vast amount of survey research 
that has been published relating to the proposed healthcare legislation. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>While the number of people who think Obama's healthcare plan is a good idea has 
risen slightly from 33% in April to 36% in August, the number who think it is a bad idea 
has risen from 26% to 42%.</li> <br>

<li> The number of people who think Obama's plan will result in the quality of 
healthcare getting better has risen only slightly from April to August from 22% to 24%. 
The number who think quality will get worse has risen from 24% to 40%. </li><br>

<li> 58% believe the government would do a bad job if given responsibility of 
implementing or running the healthcare system.  32% think the government would do a 
good job. </li><br>

<li> 59% believe that the proposed healthcare legislation will not benefit them 
personally.  31% say it will. </li><br>

<li> 55% think it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to guarantee health 
insurance for all Americans.  38% do not. </li><br>

<li> 60%+ of Americans think it is a good idea to raise income taxes on households and 
businesses that make more than $250,000 per year, and use the additional tax revenues to 
provide health insurance for the uninsured. </li><br>

<li> Folks are split about evenly on whether it is possible to provide healthcare 
coverage for most Americans without increasing the budget deficit. </li><br>

<li> 51% of respondents say they do not have a good understanding of the issues 
involved in the healthcare debate.  66% believe that the Members of Congress don't have 
a good understanding of the issues. </li>
<br>
<ul>
<li> 43% of those 65 and older think the changes will reduce access to healthcare. 
This view is shared by only 26% of those 18-49 years of age.</li><br>

<li> 53% of those 18-49 think the changes will expand access to health care, a view 
shared by only 24% of 65+ folks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>This is what Americans think about the healthcare legislation: </li>
<br>
<ul>
<li> 62% - will raise their healthcare costs</li><br>
<li> 56% - less freedom to choose doctors and coverage </li><br>
<li> 65% - make everything more complicated </li>
</ul>
<br>
<li> When it comes to who people would rather have make healthcare coverage and 
treatment decisions, 40% select insurance companies and 40% choose the government. </li>
</ul>

The number of medical students studying to be primary care doctors dropped by 
near 52% since 1997.  There will likely be a shortage of 40,000 family physicians by 
2020.  [USAToday 8/09] 
<br>
<br>
A Weill Cornell Medical College study found that "a third of the money received 
by primary care physicians pays for interactions between a doctor's practice and patients’ 
health plans."  [NYT 6/09]

The following commentary by your editor was published in the Washington Post 
on August 30, 2009, as one of a number of comments in response to the following 
question. 
<br><br>
"With polls showing that President Obama is losing ground. What could he do to 
regain the initiative?" 
<br><br>
First, the President should not over-read or over-rely on polls.  To get some 
perspective, check out the August 26 piece by Jeremy Rosner of Greenberg, Quinlan, 
Rosner Research entitled "A pollster's advice, Don't trust the polls on health reform's 
demise." 
<br><br>
Second, Obama should show that he understands that people are being asked to 
accept changes in the health-care system while they are in the throes of actual or potential 
<br><br>
crisis in their personal financial "systems."  And that he has heard the concerns raised by 
affected Americans nationwide.  While the media attention to various town halls was in 
the best tradition of "if it bleeds it leads," most of the people who came out did so out of a 
real need and interest to learn more about health-care system proposals. 
<br><br>
Third, invite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid to a 
meeting, just the three of them, and work through with them a plan for going forward. 
Work "with" the Congressional leadership to come up with a single bill that represents the 
doable, sans the wish list of every idea for changing health-care that has been suggested 
in the past several decades.  And get to that bill before the process kind of stumbles on to 
it. 
<br><br>
Finally, choose a dramatic forum, perhaps a joint session of Congress, to lay out a 
bill that includes core changes but reflects having heard what is bothering the people he 
was elected to lead.
