</div>Once again, Stanley has demonstrated his taste for really good food.  That is the 
story of "piperade." 
<br><br>
The restaurant seats 66 people at tables of 2, 4 and 6 people.  Larger parties can be 
accommodated by combining tables.  The bar, which runs nearly the length of the 
restaurant as you enter, can handle a dozen folks on high chairs.  In addition, there is 
room for another 20 folks on tables on an open area just outside the door of the restaurant. 
<br><br>
Stanley started with a Grande white bean salad with bouquerones, fresh herbs and 
crushed eggs.  I opted for the mixed chicory and endive salad, with pears and perfect 
blondes. 
<br><br>
Stanley was quite lyrical about his main course of lamb chops.  On the menu the 
offering is lamb chops and lamb sausage, but he ordered it with the sausage replaced by 
an additional lamb chop.  As he savored the first bite he exclaimed "this lamb chop is 
(expletive deleted) amazing." 
<br><br>
I chose the Wednesday special, "seafood and shellfish soup toro".  What was first 
delivered was the soup special of the day, "pea and ham."  It was quickly replaced, and 
the seafood soup special was excellent. 
<br><br>
At Stanley's suggestion, we shared a side dish, "Manchego potato gratin."  It was 
delicious. 
<br><br>
For dessert we shared an excellent "caramel custard 'koka.'" 
<br><br>
Overall, the food was really good, nicely plated, but not fussy or overdone.  It had 
the affect of comfort food, but was many notches above that which is usually described 
with that phrase. 
<br><br>
I did not go to the men's room ,but Stanley described it as large and clean. 
Dinner at $105 for two (without the tip) for two appetizers, two entrees, one 
dessert, and 1 glass of wine was quite reasonable. 
<br><br>
The service was good and attentive and appropriately friendly. 
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, especially given its relatively small size.
