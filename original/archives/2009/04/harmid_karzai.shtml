<p></p>
Ordinarily WW does not venture into commentary about foreign policy, so please 
indulge this exception. 
<br><br>
According to news reports, Harmid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan, has 
signed a law, which according the UN Development Fund for Women, "legalizes the rape 
of a wife by her husband."  It is suggested that the bill, which was rushed through the 
Afghan legislature, was signed by Karzai in an effort to improve his chances for re- 
election. 
<br><br>
Apparently, the law only affects the Shia population of the country.  According to 
one woman Parliamentarian, who opposed the law, "It is one of the worst bills passed by 
the Parliament this century.  It is totally against women's rights.  The law makes women 
more vulnerable." 
<br><br>
For Shia women, this rolls back the progress toward equality that Afghan women 
have achieved during the last several years. 
<br><br>
Various governments, including the U.S., have voiced their concerns to the 
Afghanistan government.  Karzai  subsequently announced that the law, which he has already 
signed, but which has not been made public, will be reviewed.  However, he has announced that he sees no problem with the legislation. 
<br><br>
This is the person on whom the United States and its allies have pinned their hopes 
for resolution in Afghanistan.
