The internet is growing rapidly as a primary source of national and international 
news.  The change is particularly dramatic among those aged 18-29. 
<br><br>
When asked on which medium they rely for national and international news, the 
results are as follows:

Among those under 30 years of age the change over the last 3 years is reflected 
below. 
<br><br>
48% of Americans use the internet for more than one hour a day.  This is an 
increase from the 26% who reported that level of usage in 2002.  [Gallup 1/09] 
<br><br>
Evidence of the growing role of the internet as a primary news source can be found 
in the matter of the anti-woman law signed by the President of Afghanistan. 
<br><br>
The first report available in the U.S. seems to have come on various internet blogs 
and digital news services on March 31st.  It was not until April 2nd that conventional 
newspapers and cable news services began to report the story.  The Washington Post and 
New York Times published major stories in their print editions on April 5th. 
<br><br>
When WW asked a group of 15 students on April 4th whether they had heard of 
the story, 2/3rds of them had seen the story on the internet (see story below).
<br><br>
At any rate, the internet led the way on this story, as it increasingly does.  It is 
worth keeping in mind that conventional newspapers also have on-line editions, which 
often report particular news ahead of the print edition. 
<br><br>
<b>Referenced Story</b>
<br><br>
According to news reports, Harmid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan, has 
signed a law, which according the UN Development Fund for Women, "legalizes the rape 
of a wife by her husband."  It is suggested that the bill, which was rushed through the 
Afghan legislature, was signed by Karzai in an effort to improve his chances for re- 
election. 
<br><br>
Apparently, the law only affects the Shia population of the country.  According to 
one woman Parliamentarian, who opposed the law, "It is one of the worst bills passed by 
the Parliament this century.  It is totally against women's rights.  The law makes women 
more vulnerable." 
<br><br>
For Shia women, this rolls back the progress toward equality that Afghan women 
have achieved during the last several years. 
<br><br>
Various governments, including the U.S., have voiced their concerns to the 
Afghanistan government.  Karzai  subsequently announced that the law, which he has already 
signed, but which has not been made public, will be reviewed.  However, he has announced that he sees no problem with the legislation. 
<br><br>
This is the person on whom the United States and its allies have pinned their hopes 
for resolution in Afghanistan.
