Americans are frightened and feeling insecure. 
<br><br>
Around them, things which they cherish and on which they have relied, their 
homes and their jobs, are disappearing.  They are uncertain about the future. 
<br><br>
They are also more uncertain about the ability of their political, business, and 
social leaders to show them the path to the kind of security on which they had come to 
rely.

Four days before Barack Obama was inaugurated 78% of Americans thought the 
country was on the wrong track.  At the end of March that number had dropped to 57%, 
and the number who thought to the contrary –  that it was going in the right direction – 
had jumped from 19% to 42%.  [WP/ABC 3/09] 
<br><br>

At this same time in 2001, as George Bush began his tenure, 32% thought the 
country was on the wrong track and 52% thought the country was going in the right 
direction.  [NBC/WSJ 2/09]

The public is evenly divided, 49%-48%, on whether it approves of the Federal 
Government’s response to the economic situation.  This is an improvement from mid- 
December when 72% disapproved.  [WP/ABC 3/09] 

<br><br>
So far, the blame for the current economic situation is not falling on Obama. 
84% said that Obama inherited the current economic situation and that he is not 
mostly responsible for it.  [WSJ/NBC 2/09] 
<br><br>

Here is who the public does blame when given 5 specific choices:  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Banks and other financial institutions 80%</li>
<li> Large business corporations 80% </li>
<li> Consumers 72% </li>
<li> Bush Administration 70% </li>
<li> Obama Administration for not doing enough to turn it around 26% </li>
</ul>

<br>
64% of the country is at least fairly confident that Obama's economic program will 
improve the economy.  This is a slight drop from the 72% who had that view just before 
the inauguration.  [WP/ABC 3/09] 
<br><br>
There is considerable angst about the large bonuses paid to employees of 
companies who have accepted Federal funds, and the overall levels of compensation paid 
to top corporate executives.   80% are angry about the former and 74% about the latter. 
[WP/ABC 3/09] 
<br><br>
83% believe that if a company is receiving assistance from the Federal 
Government, the Government should limit the amount executives can earn.  [NYT/CBS

While 53% of us are more trusting of the U.S. government than U.S. businesses to 
solve the country's economic problems, within those numbers there is a dramatic break 
between the views of Republicans and Democrats.

69% of Republicans think the Federal Government has too much power, a view 
that is shared by only 32% of Democrats.  [Gallup 3/09]

No wonder there is such an "air of cooperation" among Republicans and 
Democrats in the Congress.

In a recent edition of his newsletter, Jack Martin, of Public Strategies, made a 
point that helps to explain why folks feel so strongly.  Martin noted that over the last 20 
years, there has been "a growing public view that our country is divided into two groups, 
the 'haves' and the have-nots."  The number of folks who see themselves as have-nots has 
doubled from a quarter to a half of Americans.

Martin credited Pew Research for this information, so WW pulled the relevant 
data.  Here it is.

81% of Americans rate the economy as "very bad" (51%) or "fairly bad" (30%). 
Yet 72% believe that in America you can still start out poor and become rich.  [NYT/CBS 
4/09] 
<br><br>
There has also been improvement in the number of people who say the economy is 
getting worse.  51% took that position in mid-February, and now 34% have that view. 
[NYT/CBS 4/09] 
<br><br>
In mid-February 63% of us thought that the current recession would last at least 2 
years.  However, 77% were generally optimistic about the next 4 years with Obama as 
President.  The same number are convinced that he is trying to bring about real change in 
Washington.  [NYT/CBS 2/09]

The national unemployment rate of 8.5% as of April 4, 2009, is the highest rate of 
unemployment since November 1983. 
<br><br>
The previous high point of the period occurred in 1982, when the rate hit 10.8% in 
November/December.  The rate began to drop in early 1984, and continued downward to 
March 1989, when the rate bottomed at 5%.  The next high point was June 1992, when 
the rate hit 7.8%.  It then went downward through President Clinton's tenure, reaching a 
low of 3.8% in April 2000.  The rate fluctuated in the 4% to 6% range during President 
G.W. Bush's two terms in office.  It reached 7.2% during his last full month in office. 
<br><br>
However, the unemployment rate may be misleading by understating the real rate 
of unemployment in the country.  If you take into account the so-called marginally- 
attached workers and those who are involuntary part-time workers (either group making 
as much as they need to live), the current rate of unemployment stands at 15.6%.

19% of Americans reported having to make that choice.  The rate of deferral has been flat

favor increased support of traditional energy sources ,like oil and gas.  33% favor

among 73% of non-church attending non-Catholics and 70% of non-church attending 
Catholics.  [Gallup 2006-08 Values and Beliefs polls]
