<p></p>
The House and Senate have passed the Budget Resolution, which is the ostensible 
blueprint for Federal spending beginning on October 1st, 2009. 
<br><br>
In the House, 233 Democrats voted for the Resolution, while 20 Democrats did not 
follow their leadership.  176 Republicans voted against the Resolution, and not a single 
GOPer crossed over to be with the majority Democrats. 
<br><br>
55 Senators supported the Resolution, again without the assistance of a single 
Republican.  Two Democratic Senators, Evan Bayh (IN) and Ben Nelson (NEB), voted 
with 41 Republicans to reject the Resolution.  Had Senator Byrd voted, he would 
undoubtedly have supported the Resolution, as would Al Franken had his election contest 
been over. 
<br><br>
The President's Budget request was shaved in both Houses of Congress, but not in 
ways that anyone would consider significant. 
<br><br>
Perhaps of greatest significance, the House budget includes healthcare as a 
potential reconciliation item.  Boiled down, that means that the President's healthcare 
plan, as modified by the Congress, can pass the Senate with only 51 votes, rather than the 
60 votes that would likely be necessary if the plan were to come to the Senate floor as a 
freestanding piece of legislation. 
<br><br>
While the Senate version of the Budget Resolution does not include a 
reconciliation instruction, it is assumed that the final Resolution that comes out of a 
House/Senate conference after the recess will include healthcare as a potential 
reconciliation item. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, no mega climate/energy legislation was included by either body 
in its Resolution.  An attempt to include it in the Senate version failed by 61-37.  The size 
of that vote also suggests that the mega climate/energy legislation that is anticipated by 
the Administration will not have a smooth path going forward as freestanding legislation. 
<br><br>
While Republicans in both bodies have expressed great consternation at the idea of 
using reconciliation in this manner, this technique has been used to enact controversial 
legislation by Republicans and Democrats in the past. 
<br><br>
For those who may have forgotten the history of reconciliation here is a short 
reminder. 
<br><br>
Of course, in any of these efforts, proponents will need to deal with the Byrd Rule. 
[Further explanation will be attempted in a later edition.] 
<br><br>
The reconciliation process came into being as part of the Budget Act of 1974.  It 
was not until the 1980s that it became a regular part of the budget process. 
<br><br>
The reconciliation process was used: 
<br><br>
6 times during the last 5 years of Ronald Reaganâ€™s term. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Partisan split of Congress</li>
<ul>
<li> 1 Congress - Senate D/House D 
<li> 5 Congresses - Senate R/House D
</ul>
</ul>
<br><br>
5 times during the 1st George Bush's term. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Partisan split of Congress</li>
<ul>
<li> 2 Congresses - Senate R/House D</li>
<li> 3 Congresses - Senate D/House D</li> 
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>
</ul>
<br><br>
5 times during the 2nd George Bush's term. 
<br><br>

<li> Partisan split of Congress </li>
<ul>
