                                 <b>Restrooms</b>
<br><br>
Especially when an individual restroom is designed to be used by one person at a 
time, WW believes that unisex is the way to go.  On those occasions when it seems 
appropriate, WW has recommended to women waiting outside the women's restroom to 
use the men's restroom. 
<br><br>
<b>Reservations</b>
<br><br>
Many folks have a restaurant they have been meaning to try, but every time you 
call for a reservation, unless it is far in advance, they are full. 
<br><br>
Well, if you have such a restaurant in mind, give it a try, even if it is the last 
minute.  An awful lot of restaurants are not nearly as busy or "stuffy" as they used to be 
about last minute reservation requests or even walk-ins.

on the menu: 
<br><br>
"Michael Berman's Favorite Vegetable Arrangement" 
<br><br>
Braised Mustard Greens-Fingerline Potatoes-Caramelized Cauliflower-Spaghetti Squash- 
(the vegetables may vary) 
<br><br>
On a number of occasions I had asked Todd Gray to fix me a vegetable plate as an 
entree.  This was the result.  Try it.

</div>Morty's (it used to be called Krupin's) is a more conventional kosher style deli. 
You can get pork products and milk products.  So you will find tasty morsels like "Bacon 
Cheddar, Chix sandwich," a tender chicken breast grilled and served with crisp bacon, 
and melted cheddar cheese with lettuce on a Kaiser roll. 
<br><br>
The potato pancakes are a treat, and the chicken soup is served with up to two 
matzo balls the size of tennis balls. 
<br><br>
There are a variety of omelets, and a dozen smoked fish salads, ranging from belly 
lox to sable to whitefish, and a variety of combinations thereof. 
<br><br>
Choose from a dozen salads, an egg salad platter to a California fruit salad. 
<br><br>
Of course, there is an endless supply of sandwiches, like "The Chevy Chase," 
corned beef, roast beef, turkey and Swiss cheese, rolled up with lots of coleslaw and 
Russian dressing. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is open every day, and after 4 p.m. there are a variety of entrees, the 
likes of "Chicken in the Pot," half-boiled chicken, vegetables, vermicelli noodles, and 
matzo balls.  If you prefer, you can get this dish with boiled short ribs. 
<br><br>
Morty's has its own bakery and offers up a delightful array of pastries.  And, of 
course, it has a full line of deli take-out meats, salads and noodle dishes. 
<br><br>
There is parking in the basement of the building.  To find the garage you need to 
go down one of the Avenues on either side of the block to the ally.

</div>My cousin Jesse suggested Eli's Restaurant.  Chances are, if you regularly drive up 
20th Street, NW, from M Street to Dupont Circle or Massachusetts Avenue, you have 
passed Eli's without noticing it or without giving it a second look. 
<br><br>
It is a certified kosher restaurant.  There are no milk-based products or pork 
products on the menu.  Beyond those differences, it is like most other delis of the type. 
<br><br>
The appetizers and sides range from Spicey Potato Wedges to a Cold Appetizer 
Sampler of smoked turkey, salami, chopped liver, pastrami, and hummus.  I opted for a 
potato knish with Israeli salad.  Then, throwing any consideration of calories to the wind, 
I order a 50 Ways sandwich – Chopped liver and Pastrami with Onions and sliced 
tomatoes on Rye. 
<br><br>
For dessert I ordered chocolate "ice cream."  Of course, it is made with tofu.  But if 
you didn't know, you could easily believe it was regular ice cream. 
<br><br>
Don't bother calling or going to the restaurant between sundown Friday and sunset 
Saturday...the restaurant is closed for the Jewish Sabbath.

<h1>Town's End Restaurant and Bakery</h1>
2 Townsend Street<br>
San Francisco, California 94107 <br>
415-512-0749 
</div>Breakfasts with Stanley are always a treat.  The joints to which he takes WW 
always have "character." 
<br><br>
Town's End was no exception. 
<br><br>
There are about 80 seats in this long and relatively narrow restaurant that wraps 
around the end of an office building.  It is the perfect breakfast place ,in part, because the 
entire front wall is glass, so there is a freshness and brightness about the whole place. 
<br><br>
At one end of the restaurant there is a coffee and pastry bar that draws a fair 
amount of street traffic. 
<br><br>
On the average Saturday the restaurant serves 300 people, turning most tables 
about 5 times.  On the last Mother's Day the restaurant served 450 people. 
<br><br>
The woman who owns the restaurant also runs it.  She seems to be ever-present, 
filling in at the coffee bar, seating patrons, serving and clearing, and exhibiting a great 
personality. 
<br><br>
Shortly after you are seated and get your first beverage, a basket of miniature 
pastries arrives, all of them fresh from the restaurant's own bakery. 
<br><br>
Stanley's selection was pretty boring, a fresh fruit bowl, yogurt and pastry. 
<br><br>
I went for sliced bananas and the "Salmon & Onion Scramble” –  Wild Alaskan 
Sockeye salmon, smoked over hardwood, scrambled with yellow onions & three eggs.  Of 
course, I also partook of the pastry basket.  We ended up ordering a basket refill. 
<br><br>
The concoction I ate was excellent, well-cooked, without an excess of added fat. 
<br><br>
The miniature muffins were so good I bought a couple dozen to take to Peter and 
Florence, who invited me to their apartment for dinner that night. 
<br><br>
Happily, the restrooms, at least the men's room, are not the high point of the 
restaurant.  The men's room has a urinal and a commode.  In the corner opposite the 
commode there is a V-shaped marble counter top, in which there is a white ceramic 
washbasin.  There are mirrors on two walls above the marble counter top. 
<br><br>
It has large dark floor tiles and tan painted walls.  It is rather dimly lit, and is a bit 
on the beaten-down side. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. 
<br><br>

<a href="http://www.piperade.com">www.piperade.com</a>
</div>Once again, Stanley has demonstrated his taste for really good food.  That is the 
story of "piperade." 
<br><br>
The restaurant seats 66 people at tables of 2, 4 and 6 people.  Larger parties can be 
accommodated by combining tables.  The bar, which runs nearly the length of the 
restaurant as you enter, can handle a dozen folks on high chairs.  In addition, there is 
room for another 20 folks on tables on an open area just outside the door of the restaurant. 
<br><br>
Stanley started with a Grande white bean salad with bouquerones, fresh herbs and 
crushed eggs.  I opted for the mixed chicory and endive salad, with pears and perfect 
blondes. 
<br><br>
Stanley was quite lyrical about his main course of lamb chops.  On the menu the 
offering is lamb chops and lamb sausage, but he ordered it with the sausage replaced by 
an additional lamb chop.  As he savored the first bite he exclaimed "this lamb chop is 
(expletive deleted) amazing." 
<br><br>
I chose the Wednesday special, "seafood and shellfish soup toro".  What was first 
delivered was the soup special of the day, "pea and ham."  It was quickly replaced, and 
the seafood soup special was excellent. 
<br><br>
At Stanley's suggestion, we shared a side dish, "Manchego potato gratin."  It was 
delicious. 
<br><br>
For dessert we shared an excellent "caramel custard 'koka.'" 
<br><br>
Overall, the food was really good, nicely plated, but not fussy or overdone.  It had 
the affect of comfort food, but was many notches above that which is usually described 
with that phrase. 
<br><br>
I did not go to the men's room ,but Stanley described it as large and clean. 
Dinner at $105 for two (without the tip) for two appetizers, two entrees, one 
dessert, and 1 glass of wine was quite reasonable. 
<br><br>
The service was good and attentive and appropriately friendly. 
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, especially given its relatively small size.

<h1>Garabaldi on Presidio </h1>
347 Presidio Avenue <br>
San Francisco, CA 94115<br>
415-563-8841 
</div>This restaurant was selected by Peter and Florence, and Moira was also part of our 
culinary quartet. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is on two levels.  We were seated near the back-end of the upper 
level which is smaller than the lower/entry level.  There is also a bar on the entry level. 
Because the entire restaurant is relatively small, it tends to be on the noisy side. 
<br><br>
Florence chose the prix fixe selection for that evening, which included "laura 
chenel goal cheese fritter", "bracoile di carne, spinach-mushroom stuffing, pancetta, 
iacopi farms butterbeans, salsa verde." 
<br><br>
Moira started with a chicken liver pate and then a main course of "marinated lamb 
tenderloins, pistachios and golden raisin couscous, green beans, tarragon sauce.” 
<br><br>
Peter selected the "Garibaldi’s salad, sweet lettuces, Gorgonzola, fuji apples, 
spiced pecans, white balsamic vinaigrette.”  For his entree he enjoyed "linguini con frutti 
di mare, Dungeness crab, manila clams, prawns, Calabria chilies, tomato." 
<br><br>
I chose the “chopped salad, cauliflowers, broccoli, sieved egg, ricotta salata, 
pumpkin seeds, buttermilk dressing,” followed by "chicken breast Milanese, roasted 
garlic mashed potatoes, arugula, white wine-caper sauce.” 
<br><br>
And to end the meal, Moira and Florence chose "White Chocolate Creme Brulee; 
Peter savored "Chocolate Budiino;" and I managed to work my way through a "Bread and 
Butter Pudding." 
<br><br>
The food was just plain good, and the portions were substantial. 
<br><br>
There are two unisex Water Closets.  The one that WW used has dark brown walls 
and large brown floor tiles. 
<br><br>
There is a white ceramic commode and a horizontally shaped,  white ceramic 
washbasin that sticks out into the room.  To the right, as you stand in front of the 
commode and the washbasin, there is a dark wood cabinet. 
<br><br>
There are mirrors above the washbasin and above the cabinet. 
<br><br>
Garabaldi's is open for dinner every night, for lunch Monday - Friday, and for 
brunch on Saturday and Sunday. 
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended.

<h1>Michael Mina </h1>
335 Powell Street <br>
(In the St. Francis Hotel) <br>
San Francisco CA 94102 <br>
415-397-9222
</div>Michael Mina came to San Francisco as Executive Chef at Aqua, where he made a 
name for himself. 
<br><br>
Eventually he opened "Michael Mina" in the St. Francis Hotel.  This was the first 
of many restaurants that he has subsequently opened, <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/restaurant_bourbon_steak.shtml">Bourbon Steak</a> being the most 
recent. 
<br><br>
The two restaurants could not be more different, except for the fact that each of 
them is directly off the lobby of a major hotel.  
<br><br>
As bright, energizing, and noisy as Bourbon Steak is, that is how quiet, dimly lit, 
and laid back is this restaurant.  It is just plain fancier than its DC cousin. 
Dinner was with Julia and Stan. 
<br><br>
At first blush, the menus seem to be quite different, and in general they are, but 
there are some dishes that are available in both restaurants.  For example, the Lobster Pot 
Pie, Japanese Kobe beef, Elysian Fields Lamb, and Ahi Tuna Tartare show up on both 
menus, and there are iterations of various dishes that seem to have a common root. 
The "amuse buse" was a Caviar Parfait. 
<br><br>
Julia, who prefers vegetarian dishes, had "Seasonal Squash Trio," including 
pumpkin soup, tempura squash salad, and a grilled sandwich.  She also enjoyed "Scotch" 
Hen Egg, Forest mushrooms, Heirloom radishes, and Consomme.  As an entre she 
requested and received a specially-made vegetarian dish, which included such delicacies 
as fried ravioli. 
<br><br>
Stanley started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare, Scotch Bonnet Pepper, Bosc Pear, 
Sesame Oil.  For his entree he selected the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb, Cassoulet of Pole 
Beans, Dry Farmed Tomatoes, Herb Bread Crumbs.  [Note: Stanley seems to like lamb. 
You will note that it was also his selection at "piperade" which is written up later.] 
<br><br>
I began with Roasted Heirloom Beets, Braised Endive, Mache, Black Truffle 
Vinaigrette, followed by a main course of "Bouillabaisse - Mina Style. [Note: I also had 
the Fish Soup at "piperade."] 
<br><br>
And then there were the desserts. Julia selected an assortment of Cheeses - Goat, 
Sheep, Cow.   Stanley chose the White Chocolate Panna Cotta, Passion Fruit, Almond 
Crumble. 
<br><br>
I went with the ordinary.  A Root Beer Float accompanied by Warm Chocolate 
Chip Cookies.  Notably, the DC menu includes a Banana Split. 
<br><br>
The food was great tasting, but as served is quite fancy and a bit fussy. 
<br><br>
It almost goes without saying that the service was excellent. 
<br><br>
At the bottom line, Bourbon Steak is more my kind of restaurant than Michael 
Mina.  But for that special quiet evening ,you can't beat Michael Mina in the St. Francis. 
<br><br>
The restaurant seats about 100 people and is open for dinner only, Tuesday - 
Saturday.  Reservations are recommended, although the restaurant does accept walk-ins. 
The night we were there, a Tuesday, the restaurant was not half full. 
<br><br>
The restaurant uses the basic hotel restrooms, so a review is not included.

<h1>Bourbon Steak </h1>
2800 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW <br>
(In the Four Seasons Hotel) <br>
Washington, DC <br>
202-944-2026  
</div>In a first for Washington Watch, this edition's restaurant review section includes 
two restaurants run by the same Executive Chef, 2500 miles apart. 
<br><br>
The first, is "Bourbon Steak" in the Four Seasons Hotel,  Washington, DC, the 
latest opening of Chef Michael Mina.  The second, is "<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/restaurant_michael_mina.shtml">Michael Mina</a>," the first restaurant 
that Mina started, in the St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco, California. 
<br><br>
Beginning with WW's first dinner at Bourbon Steak, the day it opened, 
December 19, 2008, through April 6th, WW has eaten dinner in this restaurant at least 24 
times and lunch 4 times.  In the same time period, WW also had 13 breakfasts in the old 
Seasons Restaurant, where breakfasts and weekend and holiday brunches are still served. 
The restaurant is physically located where the Terrace Lounge used to be.  The 
lounge is no more. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is entered directly from the newly redecorated lobby and is 
essentially open to the lobby.  There is a bar area directly to your right as you enter, and 
on most evenings it is relatively full.  It also is open to the restaurant.  The crowd is on the 
young side, and quite different than anything seen at the hotel before the new restaurant 
and bar opened. 
<br><br>
The difference in guests in the bar is also true of the restaurant.  While there are 
some regulars from the downstairs days, most of the guests are new. 
<br><br>
The restaurant itself has 2 distinct eating areas.  The first is directly ahead as you 
enter and down a couple of steps.  To the right are a series of booths that separate this 
section from the other section.  The other section is open to the kitchen, which is at the 
end of the room, where the bar used to be. 
<br><br>
Ordinarily, I would note the folks with whom I have eaten, but given the number 
of times I have been there, so I am eschewing what is a pretty long list.  Suffice to say, it is a perfect place to take folks these days, because so many of them have not yet been to 
the restaurant in these early months. 
<br><br>
The average night’s menu has 6 shellfish and caviar dishes, 13 appetizers, 8 dishes 
listed as entrees, and then an additional group of entrees cooked on the wood-burning 
grill, including 8 steaks ranging from 8 - 28 ounces and 4 ocean fishes. 
<br><br>
In addition, there are 3 so-called accompaniments, and 10 side dishes. 
<br><br>
The following is a listing of the dishes I have eaten.
<br><br>
Shellfish & Caviar - Bay scallops, Florida stone crab, & Louisiana Gulf Shrimp 
<br><br>
Appetizers - Bibb Wedge, Market Salad, Root Vegetable Soup, Cape Cod 
Squid, Red Wine Braised Oxtail 
<br><br>
Entrees - Dayboat Sea Scallops, Atlantic Striped Bass, Elysian Fields Lamb Loin, 
Liberty Farms Duck, Michael's Lobster Pot Pie, Pan-Roasted Gianone 
Chicken, Worcestershire-Braised Short Ribs 
<br><br>
Wood-Burning Grill - Tasmanian Sea Trout, Florida Cobia 
<br><br>
Accompaniments - Marrow Bones
<br><br>
Side Dishes - Salt-Baked Potato, Crispy Sweet Onion Cakes, Classic Potato puree, 
Black Truffle Mac&Cheese, Spaghetti Squash, Caramelized Brussels 
Sprouts, Wood-roasted "magical" Mushrooms, Chick Pea Fries. 
<br><br>
While I usually do not discuss particular dishes, this is an exception. The braised 
short-ribs that I ate on a recent evening were so tender that I literally cut the meat with a 
fork. 
<br><br>
Every dinner starts with delivery of three silver cones, each filled with a different 
flavor of French-fried potatoes, with three different sauces in which to dip the fries.  I 
prefer them without the dip. 
<br><br>
Bread is delivered in the form of small truffle oil buns.  Combinations of 4-6 buns 
are cooked in a small iron skillet and that is how they are delivered.  You have likely 
never eaten anything quite like them. 
<br><br>
The service is quite attentive.  It sometimes takes an inordinate amount of time to 
get something simple, like a glass of ice tea or a glass of wine, but the course of your 
meal, even when the restaurant is busy, comes at a reasonable rate.  To be fair, some folks have suffered delays in receiving their meal, but I have chalked that up to restaurant 
startup.  All but one of the wait staff, is new to the Four Seasons.  That is to say, but for 
one of them, the Seasons wait staff did not migrate upstairs. 
<br><br>
At my first lunch, the restaurant passed an important test.  My favorite lunch at the 
old Seasons Restaurant was a bowl of tomato soup and a grilled chicken sandwich.  That 
first time, I believe, the items came from the Seasons kitchen downstairs.  Now both are 
prepared in the Bourbon Steak kitchen.  At a recent lunch one of our party ordered a 
grilled cheese sandwich and it came without so much as a raised eyebrow. 
<br><br>
And then one night, as a special treat, the resident chef offered up a roast chicken 
with steamed vegetables.  The chicken could not have been more perfectly done. And the mixed vegetables were nicely prepared as well.  Unfortunately, the chicken is not part of the regular menu. 
<br><br>
Now the desserts.  I have ordered the Comice Pear Tart, Bitter Chocolate Cake, 
Bananas Split, Coconut Candy Bar, and a variety of ice creams. They leave nothing to be 
desired. 
<br><br>
There are two things that you should know about the restaurant. 
<br><br>
First, the food is very rich.  For example, steaks are poached in clarified butter, 
pork in bacon fat, and lamb in olive oil.  It seems that just about every dish has some form 
of fat added to it.  Even the fish dishes seem to have added fat in one form or another. 
However, the kitchen has been responsive when I asked that care be taken to avoid as 
much extra fat as possible. 
<br><br>
Second, when the restaurant is filled at dinner time, it is very noisy.  And, 
periodically, music is broadcast which adds to the din.  About the only place you can have 
a conversation without straining at least a little is in one of the booths.  By the way, the 
booths are of sufficient size and the tables move so they can accommodate my girth on 
one side and a regular sized person on the other. 
<br><br>
The restaurant seats a maximum of 144 people.  Each of the 4 tops is expandable 
to 5 or six. 
<br><br>
There is a private dining room that comfortably seats 20 people.  There are 
windows on two sides of the room, so it is quite cheery.  This room is designed so that it 
can be divided into two private dining rooms with separate doors, each seating up to 10 
people. 
<br><br>
There are minimum charges and guarantees for these dining rooms.  There is also a 
minimum and required guarantee for large parties in the main dining room. 
There are two choices of restrooms if you are in the restaurant. 
<br><br>
Just off the lobby, at the entrance to the restaurant, there are two restrooms, across 
the hall from one another.  As you would expect, one for men and the other for women.  
Each is designed to be used by a single person at a time. 
<br><br>
There is a single white ceramic commode and single washbasin in a marble 
counter in the men's room.  The floor is covered with very large dark tiles, with light 
accents, and the walls are covered in brown wallpaper. 
<br><br>
If the restroom of choice on the lobby level is occupied, you can either stand in 
line or go down one flight of stairs to the multi-person restrooms.  [See special restroom 
ideas at end of the restaurant section.] 
<br><br>
The restaurant is open for dinner seven days a week, and for lunch Monday 
through Friday.  Reservations are pretty much required at dinner.  [Lunch is served in the 
old Season's Restaurant on Saturday and Sunday.] 
<br><br>
The bottom line....try it.  I think there is a very good chance you will like it. 
<br><br>
[Note: The Bourbon Steak manager, Mark Politzer, is on top of just about everything and 
is very accommodating.  And add to that, the new hotel food and beverage manager is 
Marc Bromley.  Yes, the son of the ubiquitous Stan Bromley.]

It is still pretty early to get a good handle on the 2010 races, in part because there 
is no way to know how the public will feel about the Obama Administration as they head 
to the polls.
<br><br>
There are at least seven Senate seats in the Toss Up category, and some of them 
look a little dicey for the incumbent Parties.  Certainly, the Democrats are going to turn 
heaven and earth to pick up at least two more seats. 
<br><br>
When it comes to the House, there is some question how many more net seats there 
are for the Democrats to pick up.  Certainly they will try.  But from a policy point of 
view, their current position in the House is likely to prove sufficient to do just about 
anything the Democrats want to do.

Among those under 30 years of age the change over the last 3 years is reflected 
below. 
<br><br>
48% of Americans use the internet for more than one hour a day.  This is an 
increase from the 26% who reported that level of usage in 2002.  [Gallup 1/09] 
<br><br>
Evidence of the growing role of the internet as a primary news source can be found 
in the matter of the anti-woman law signed by the President of Afghanistan. 
<br><br>
The first report available in the U.S. seems to have come on various internet blogs 
and digital news services on March 31st.  It was not until April 2nd that conventional 
newspapers and cable news services began to report the story.  The Washington Post and 
New York Times published major stories in their print editions on April 5th. 
<br><br>
When WW asked a group of 15 students on April 4th whether they had heard of 
the story, 2/3rds of them had seen the story on the internet (see story below).
<br><br>
At any rate, the internet led the way on this story, as it increasingly does.  It is 
worth keeping in mind that conventional newspapers also have on-line editions, which 
often report particular news ahead of the print edition. 
<br><br>
<b>Referenced Story</b>
<br><br>
According to news reports, Harmid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan, has 
signed a law, which according the UN Development Fund for Women, "legalizes the rape 
of a wife by her husband."  It is suggested that the bill, which was rushed through the 
Afghan legislature, was signed by Karzai in an effort to improve his chances for re- 
election. 
<br><br>
Apparently, the law only affects the Shia population of the country.  According to 
one woman Parliamentarian, who opposed the law, "It is one of the worst bills passed by 
the Parliament this century.  It is totally against women's rights.  The law makes women 
more vulnerable." 
<br><br>
For Shia women, this rolls back the progress toward equality that Afghan women 
have achieved during the last several years. 
<br><br>
Various governments, including the U.S., have voiced their concerns to the 
Afghanistan government.  Karzai  subsequently announced that the law, which he has already 
signed, but which has not been made public, will be reviewed.  However, he has announced that he sees no problem with the legislation. 
<br><br>
This is the person on whom the United States and its allies have pinned their hopes 
for resolution in Afghanistan.

                                 The House and Senate have passed the Budget Resolution, which is the ostensible 
blueprint for Federal spending beginning on October 1st, 2009. 
<br><br>
In the House, 233 Democrats voted for the Resolution, while 20 Democrats did not 
follow their leadership.  176 Republicans voted against the Resolution, and not a single 
GOPer crossed over to be with the majority Democrats. 
<br><br>
55 Senators supported the Resolution, again without the assistance of a single 
Republican.  Two Democratic Senators, Evan Bayh (IN) and Ben Nelson (NEB), voted 
with 41 Republicans to reject the Resolution.  Had Senator Byrd voted, he would 
undoubtedly have supported the Resolution, as would Al Franken had his election contest 
been over. 
<br><br>
The President's Budget request was shaved in both Houses of Congress, but not in 
ways that anyone would consider significant. 
<br><br>
Perhaps of greatest significance, the House budget includes healthcare as a 
potential reconciliation item.  Boiled down, that means that the President's healthcare 
plan, as modified by the Congress, can pass the Senate with only 51 votes, rather than the 
60 votes that would likely be necessary if the plan were to come to the Senate floor as a 
freestanding piece of legislation.

While the Senate version of the Budget Resolution does not include a 
reconciliation instruction, it is assumed that the final Resolution that comes out of a 
House/Senate conference after the recess will include healthcare as a potential 
reconciliation item. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, no mega climate/energy legislation was included by either body 
in its Resolution.  An attempt to include it in the Senate version failed by 61-37.  The size 
of that vote also suggests that the mega climate/energy legislation that is anticipated by 
the Administration will not have a smooth path going forward as freestanding legislation. 
<br><br>
While Republicans in both bodies have expressed great consternation at the idea of 
using reconciliation in this manner, this technique has been used to enact controversial 
legislation by Republicans and Democrats in the past. 
<br><br>
For those who may have forgotten the history of reconciliation here is a short 
reminder. 
<br><br>
Of course, in any of these efforts, proponents will need to deal with the Byrd Rule. 
[Further explanation will be attempted in a later edition.] 
<br><br>
The reconciliation process came into being as part of the Budget Act of 1974.  It 
was not until the 1980s that it became a regular part of the budget process. 
<br><br>
The reconciliation process was used: 
<br><br>
6 times during the last 5 years of Ronald Reagan’s term.

on the internet?  If not, you ought to get with it. 
<br><br>
You are too old, you say; or you don't have the time; or you don't want to share 
information about yourself with a bunch of strangers. 
<br><br>
Consider the following: 175 million people worldwide are on Facebook.  My 
Space has 130 million users, of which 6.9 million are 55 years of age or older. 
<br><br>
I have chosen to be on Facebook because it is so easy to get on the network and to 
participate.  I don't spend more than 10 minutes a day engaged in it, and most of that time 
is spent answering emails from folks who could otherwise be emailing me at my regular 
address.  I control the amount of information about myself that I post, and it is a whole lot 
less than anyone can find by googling me. 
<br><br>
In the not-all-that-distant future, all but a few newspapers will  be gone.  The 
evening news programs on the national TV broadcast networks will have signed off for 
the last time. 
<br><br>
We will be receiving more and more of our daily dose of news and other 
information over the internet.  An ever-increasingly important source will be the social 
networks.  If you have not already done so, you might as well come to understand this 
new paradigm, because eventually you will have to.

                                 An argument can be made that there are ways in which the Federal Government is 
organized or operates which don't make a lot of sense. 
<br>
<br>
Here is one of WW's favorite examples.  On a trip out West your editor was 
standing at the head of a little valley.  I was told that the forest on the hill on the right side of the valley was controlled by the Department of Interior, and the forest on the left side was controlled by the Department of Agriculture.  To my untrained eye, the trees looked a lot alike. 
<br>
<br>
Subsequently, I learned that, if the forest lands were seen as producing timber (a 
growing crop), they were under the control of the USDA.  If the lands were seen as range 
or park lands (more tourism and less economic value of the land itself), they were under 
Interior. 
<br>
<br>
In general, USDA's management has been perceived to be more production- and 
business-oriented, while Interior has been perceived as more conservation and 
environmentally focused, especially in land management issues. 
<br>
<br>
In fact, it turns out that there are some timber lands under the management of 
Interior, and some park and tourism land under control of USDA. 
<br>
<br>
Apparently, the whole thing caused an enormous feud between Harold Ickes and 
Henry Wallace in the 1930s.

Observing the campaign and now the new Administration, it is easy to come to the 
conclusion that President Obama likes to operate through a relatively small group of 
individuals who are close at hand. 

<br>
<br>
Could this be an effort on his part to effectively "reorganize" parts of the Executive 
Branch without going through the endless process of changing organizational structures?  
Each of these structures has its own set of constituencies, Congressional and otherwise, 
who defend the current structures, whether or not they make overall sense.  

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Obama came to a White House that already had two czar/czarina-like positions on 
the staff, the National Security Advisor and the Director of the National Economic 
Council.  Within the "coordinating" reach of the National Security Advisor (and staff)  is 
the Defense Department, State Department, Central Intelligence Agency, National 
Security Agency, and the Homeland Security Department. 
<br>
<br>
Within the reach of the Director of the National Economic Council (and staff) is 
the Treasury Department, the Council of Economic Advisors, the Commerce Department, 
the US Trade Representative, and the Department of Labor.  There is a secondary 
connection with other agencies on a case by case basis.  In the current White House add 
to that a side-bar interest in energy and healthcare. 
<br>
<br>
For some many years, the President has usually received a daily briefing from his 
National Security Advisor.  Obama has added a similar daily briefing from the Director of 
the National Economic Council. 
<br>
<br>
To those two, Obama has added czarinas for Energy/Environment/Climate and 
Healthcare, and an Urban czar. 
<br>
<br>
The Energy czarina is likely to be able to reach into the Environmental Protection 
Agency, The Council on Environmental Quality, Energy Department, Interior 
Department, Agriculture Department, Department of Transportation, and Commerce 
Department. 
<br>
<br>
The Healthcare czarina has a span that likely includes at least HHS (Medicare, 
etc,), Tricare, Veterans Administration, FDA, and the Federal Employee Health Benefit 
Plan. 
<br>
<br>
The Urban Czar would seem to reach into the Department of Transportation, 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Education Department. 
<br>
<br>
Will it work?  Like anything this early in a new Administration, it is anyone's 
guess.  The immediate response of many commentators is that there are bound to be a 
number of internecine conflicts.  That may well be.  But given the apparent disdain of the 
President and his close advisors for unnecessary drama, and his Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel's ability to cut through nonsense, my guess is that any such conflicts will be 
dealt with expeditiously. 
<br>
<br>
If it works, the country will be well-served. 

<br>

Centralizing power in the White House, beyond the traditional area of national 
security, is not new. 
<br>
<br>
In early January, 1973, newly re-elected President Richard Nixon rolled out a 
expansion of the White House staff.  He appointed at least three "czars". 
<br>
<br>
Caspar Weinberger, Secretary of HEW, was named as a White House Counselor to 
run Human Resources.  James Lynn, Secretary of HUD, was named as the Counselor for 
Community and Regional Development.  And Earl Butz, Secretary of Agriculture, was 
named as Counselor for Natural Resources, in charge of resource use, lands and minerals, 
and environment. 
<br>
<br>
Somewhat later, Nixon appointed William Simon, then serving as Deputy 
Secretary of Treasury, as the first energy czar.  Formally, he headed the Federal Energy 
Office during the Arab oil embargo. 
<br>
<br>
Of course, all of the folks that Nixon turned to for this role were Senate-confirmed 
political employees, subject to being called to testify before Congress. 
<br>
<br>
And then in September, 2001, President Bush appointed Tom Ridge as the 
Homeland Security czar.

As favorably as Obama is rated (69% have that view), his popularity is eclipsed by 
Michelle Obama, who clocks a 72% favorable rating.  [Gallup 3/09]

There are about 3,000 political appointees in the Federal Government.  That is to 
say, they are appointed by the President or by others that the President has appointed.  616 of these people are subject to Senate confirmation. 
<br><br>
Although there has been a glitch or two, the Obama administration is ahead of the 
4 most recent Presidential Administrations in the number of people who have been 
nominated to fill Government positions that are subject to Senate confirmation.

Four days before Barack Obama was inaugurated 78% of Americans thought the 
country was on the wrong track.  At the end of March that number had dropped to 57%, 
and the number who thought to the contrary –  that it was going in the right direction – 
had jumped from 19% to 42%.  [WP/ABC 3/09] 
<br><br>

At this same time in 2001, as George Bush began his tenure, 32% thought the 
country was on the wrong track and 52% thought the country was going in the right 
direction.  [NBC/WSJ 2/09]

The public is evenly divided, 49%-48%, on whether it approves of the Federal 
Government’s response to the economic situation.  This is an improvement from mid- 
December when 72% disapproved.  [WP/ABC 3/09] 

<br><br>
So far, the blame for the current economic situation is not falling on Obama. 
84% said that Obama inherited the current economic situation and that he is not 
mostly responsible for it.  [WSJ/NBC 2/09] 
<br><br>

Here is who the public does blame when given 5 specific choices:  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Banks and other financial institutions 80%</li>
<li> Large business corporations 80% </li>
<li> Consumers 72% </li>
<li> Bush Administration 70% </li>
<li> Obama Administration for not doing enough to turn it around 26% </li>
</ul>

<br>
64% of the country is at least fairly confident that Obama's economic program will 
improve the economy.  This is a slight drop from the 72% who had that view just before 
the inauguration.  [WP/ABC 3/09] 
<br><br>
There is considerable angst about the large bonuses paid to employees of 
companies who have accepted Federal funds, and the overall levels of compensation paid 
to top corporate executives.   80% are angry about the former and 74% about the latter.

In a recent edition of his newsletter, Jack Martin, of Public Strategies, made a 
point that helps to explain why folks feel so strongly.  Martin noted that over the last 20 
years, there has been "a growing public view that our country is divided into two groups, 
the 'haves' and the have-nots."  The number of folks who see themselves as have-nots has 
doubled from a quarter to a half of Americans.

81% of Americans rate the economy as "very bad" (51%) or "fairly bad" (30%). 
Yet 72% believe that in America you can still start out poor and become rich.  [NYT/CBS 
4/09]

There has also been improvement in the number of people who say the economy is 
getting worse.  51% took that position in mid-February, and now 34% have that view. 
[NYT/CBS 4/09]

In mid-February 63% of us thought that the current recession would last at least 2 
years.  However, 77% were generally optimistic about the next 4 years with Obama as 
President.  The same number are convinced that he is trying to bring about real change in 
Washington.  [NYT/CBS 2/09]

The national unemployment rate of 8.5% as of April 4, 2009, is the highest rate of 
unemployment since November 1983. 
<br><br>
The previous high point of the period occurred in 1982, when the rate hit 10.8% in 
November/December.  The rate began to drop in early 1984, and continued downward to 
March 1989, when the rate bottomed at 5%.  The next high point was June 1992, when 
the rate hit 7.8%.  It then went downward through President Clinton's tenure, reaching a 
low of 3.8% in April 2000.  The rate fluctuated in the 4% to 6% range during President 
G.W. Bush's two terms in office.  It reached 7.2% during his last full month in office. 
<br><br>
However, the unemployment rate may be misleading by understating the real rate 
of unemployment in the country.  If you take into account the so-called marginally- 
attached workers and those who are involuntary part-time workers (either group making 
as much as they need to live), the current rate of unemployment stands at 15.6%.

By 49% to 41% Americans opt to maintain the current healthcare system, based 
mostly on private health insurance, as opposed to a replacing it with a new Government- 
run healthcare system. 
<br>
<br>
As recently as 2005, that spread was 31% points, 63% to 32%.

29% of Americans deferred medical treatment in the 12-month period ending in 
November 2008 because of the amount they would have to pay for the care.  In 2003, only 
19% of Americans reported having to make that choice.  The rate of deferral has been flat 
since 2006.  Not surprisingly, the lower the annual family income, the higher the 
percentage of those having put off treatment.  [Gallup 12/08]

the environment and developing further energy supplies. 
<br>
<br>
In 2001, 52% of Americans said the priority should be protection of the 
environment, while 36% opted for developing further supplies.  Today, there is equal 
support for both.  47% say protect the environment, while 46% say the priority should be 
developing supplies. [Gallup 3/09]

Notwithstanding the strongly voiced official position of the Catholic Church in 
opposition to abortion and embryonic stem-cell research, the same percentage of 
American Catholics as non-Catholics find abortion (40%) and stem-cell research (63%) 
morally acceptable.  
<br><br>
However, the overall figures mask the impact of church attendance on folks’ 
opinions. 
<br><br>
Among regular church attenders, only 24% of Catholics and 19% of non-Catholics 
find abortion morally acceptable.  Embryonic stem-cell is found to be morally acceptable 
among 73% of non-church attending non-Catholics and 70% of non-church attending 
Catholics.  [Gallup 2006-08 Values and Beliefs polls]
