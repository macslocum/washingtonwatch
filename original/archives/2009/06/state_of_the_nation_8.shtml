Between February 1976 and late October 2001, there was only one time 
(June 1983) when a majority (51%) of Americans trusted the government in 
Washington to do what is right, at least most of the time.  In late October 2001, 
55% trusted the government most of the time.  It has been down hill since then.  In 
October 2008, 83% said the government could be trusted to do what is right only 
some of the time.  In June 2009, 79% hold that view.

56% currently believe the Federal Government is doing too many things thatare better left to businesses and individuals. [NYT/CBS 6/09]

74% of those asked think it is at least somewhat important (43% very 
important) for the membership of the Supreme Court to  to reflect the gender, 
ethnic and racial makeup of the country as a whole.  62% of respondents believe 
that ,when voting on a Supreme Court nominee, the Senate should consider the 
nominee's personal views, as well as their legal qualifications.  76% believe it is at 
least somewhat important for the Senate to know the nominee's position on such 
issues as abortion and affirmative action.  [NYT/CBS 6/09]

A word seems to make a difference.  When told that the United States has 
been holding a number of "detainees" at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 45% to 42% 
Americans think the government should continue to operate the prison.  However, 
if asked the very same question with the word "terrorists" substituted for 
"detainees," by 48% to 40% Americans believe it should be closed.  And, of those 
who said the prison should be closed, 38% to 7% support having these folks 
transfered to maximum security prisons in the United States.  [NYT/CBS 6/09]

There are now more households in the United States which have only

For the first time since 1995 (when the question was first asked), a 
considerably larger number of people (51%) consider themselves "pro-life" then 
consider themselves to be "pro-choice." 
<br>
<br>
When the Gallup organization first began asking the question in mid-1995, 
only 33% described themselves as "pro-life," as opposed to 56% who described 
themselves as "pro-choice." 
<br>
<br>
In mid-2001 equal numbers (46%) described themselves as "pro-life" and 
"pro-choice." 
<br>
<br>
Questions have been raised as to whether this recent result, which reflected 
a substantial change from 2008, when 44% were "pro-life" and 50% pro-choice, 
resulted from a bad sample.  WW checked with the Gallup organization, in part to 
determine whether the Party split in this sample might be skewed.  Gallup is quite 
comfortable with the sample.

Slowly, but inexorably, Americans are beginning to believe that gay couples 
should be allowed to marry.  5 years ago, 22% favored marriage for gays and 
lesbians.  Today 33% are in favor.  A total of 63% favor marriage or at least civil 
unions.  This is an increase of 9 points since 2004.  [NYT/CBS 6/09]
