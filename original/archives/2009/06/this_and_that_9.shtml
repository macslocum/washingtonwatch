<b>All I Need To Know About David Souter</b>
<br><br>
In 1990, I had the privilege of being part of the team that prepared Supreme 
Court Justice David Souter for his confirmation hearing.  
<br><br>
In my view, he has been a supurb Justice, and has been surprising many 
with the tenor of his decisions. 
<br><br>
At the end of the Senate hearing the entire team had dinner with Souter. 
Other than briefly visiting the Court one day, I did not really see the Justice again 
for nearly 20 years, until November, 2007. 
<br><br>
As I sat in my living room surrounded by dear friends, either the night that 
Carol died or the night after, one of my friends came in to say that there was a 
well-dressed man in the front hall and it looked like Justice Souter. 
<br><br>
I went out to the hall and greeted Justice Souter.  He joined me for a while 
in the living room.  I don't remember what he said, but I remember that it made me 
feel good. 
<br><br>
That is all I need to know about David Souter.

I am told (not confirmed) that Freud said, 
<br><br>
"There are two main goals in life - To Love and To Work. 
<br><br>
“Some who also work with the mind have added a third goal - To Play. 
<br><br>
“Said another way -- A good life, a happy life, will happen if a person can 
<br><br>
"Experience love, Enjoy work, and Engage in play.”

In 1999, Peter Hart Research conducted a ground breaking survey of some 
2000 adults, followed a decade later (2009), by a survey on the same subject of 
some 3000 adults.
<br><br>
The subject of the survey -- Michael S. Berman, your editor. 
<br><br>
1999 --16% of American adults, 32,147,117 people, knew me and had an 
opinion about me. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>7,890,656 had positive feelings about me </li>
<li>18% of respondents had negative feelings about me</li>
</ul>

2009 -- 28% of American adults, 61,082,000 people, know me and have an 
opinion about me. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>12,020,065 have positive feelings about me </li>
<li>only 5% have negative feelings about me</li> 
</ul>

In both surveys, 52% of women and 48% of men had positive feelings about 
me. 
<br><br>
[Note: My Google Alert has revealed that there are a number of Michael 
Bermans, and at least one more Michael S. Berman.  So it is possible that some of 
those who claim to know me actually know one of the other Michael Bermans.]

Questions to be considered in quiet moments.
<br><br>
Why does a round pizza come in a square box? 
<br><br>
How is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a good 
idea to put wheels on luggage? 
<br><br>
Why is it that people say they "slept like a baby," when babies wake up every two 
hours? 
<br><br>
Why do people pay to go up tall buildings and then put money in binoculars to 
look at things on the ground?
