There have been a number of high-end restaurants in this space.  This is yet 
another one.  Hopefully, it will have better luck then its predecessors. 
<br><br>
Dinner at "adour" was Jo's suggestion and it was a good one. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is reached by walking past a separate bar and lounge area, 
which seems to draw a mix of hotel guests and locals. 
 <br><br>
The upholstery is white, and there are many windows that let in a great deal 
of light.  The room is cheery and bright.  At the near end of the room, there is a 
banquet with tables and regular chairs on the other side.  The chairs are 
comfortable. 
<br><br>
One of the nice things about this restaurant is that there are a number of 
relatively low calorie offerings. 
<br><br>
The meal began with an Amuse Bouche of puree potatos and tiny pieces of 
red sausage, served in a tiny earthen pot.  Different and tasty. 
<br><br>
Jo began with a Multicolor Spring Vegetable Composition, followed by a 
nice filet of Halibut with appropriate accompaniment. 
<br><br>
I started with a Chilled Marinated Shellfish.  As an entre I chose Baked 
Riviera Style John Dory with Baby Fennel, Basil and Taggiasche olive. 
<br><br>
We passed on ordering a specific dessert, but did enjoy a plate of tiny 
chocolates and cookies. 
<br><br>
There are 8 appetizers, 10 entrees, and specials of the day.  Also available is 
a cheese course and 7 desserts. 
<br><br>
On the evening we were at the restaurant, there was a tasting menu of 5 
courses. 
<br><br>
The service left nothing to be desired. 
<br><br>
As with any number of hotel-located restaurants, the restrooms are not 
conveniently located relative to the restaurant.  In this case you need to go out to 
the lobby and half way across it to find the sign that points to the Restrooms. 
<br><br>

You then face a fairly long, back and forth stairway to the level on which 
the restrooms are located.  (There is also an elevator available.) 
<br><br>
The restroom is quite nice as hotel and restaurant restrooms go. 
Immediately to the right, as you enter, there are several white ceramic urinals, 
which are separated by partial dark wooden panels that start about 2 feet off the 
floor and run to about 5 feet. 
<br><br>
Next come 4 commode stalls, enclosed by almost floor-to-ceiling dark wood 
walls and doors.  Across from the urinals and commodes are a string of 5 white 
ceramic washbasins in a tan marble counter with gold colored fixtures.  They are 
backed by a mirror that runs the length of the counter and fills the wall from the 
top of the counter to the ceiling. 
<br><br>
The floor, wall and ceiling are covered in various shades of tan. 
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, but in this economic climate you will not 
likely have any problems.
