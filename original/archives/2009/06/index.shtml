This Sunday night dinner included Rita and Bob, Rhoda and Dan, Ron and 
me. 
<br><br>
The restaurant seats about 60 people, with a few additional tables on the 
sidewalk outside the restaurant.  Toward the back of the restaurant there is a small 
bar with 8 high chair/stools.  No one was at the bar on the night we were there. 
<br><br>
As I looked at my notes after the dinner, I had written "freshness."  There is 
a freshness and lightness about the place and the food. 
<br><br>
Rita started with a Salad of Lemon Marinated French Beans, Prosciutto and 
Shaved Parmesan with Walnut Balsamic Vinaigrette.  The rest of us were quite 
boring -- we all ordered gazpacho, which was the special that night and not on the 
printed menu. 
<br><br>
There was a little more adventure in the entree orders.  Rita and Rhoda 
ordered Pan Seared Barramundi with Lemon Gnocchi, Spinach, Exotic 
Mushrooms, Roasted  Tomatoes and Eggplant Couli. 
<br><br>
Ron opted for Sauteed Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Roasted Corn Hash 
and Sweet Corn Sauce.  The dish was designed to include Bacon Mashed Potatoes, 
but Ron chose an additional vegetable in its place. 
<br><br>
Dan ordered a Halibut special, and true to form Bob ordered the Oven 
Roasted Organic Chicken with Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Garden Vegetable 
Ragout.  Sticking with a fowl theme, I ordered Roasted Magret of Duck served 
Medium Rare with Sweet Potato and duck Confit Hash, Celery Root Galette and 
Foie Gras Reducation. 
<br><br>
We passed on offered desserts, but did enjoy a plate of cookies. 
<br><br>
The service was swift and excellent.  While the restaurant was not full when 
we were there, reservations are suggested. 
<br><br>
The men's room is of a size that no more than two people could use it at 
once.  It is likely to be the case that more often than not a single occupant will lock 
the outer door. 
<br><br>
It is well appointed and clean. 
<br><br>
All of the walls are a dark pinkish orange and the floor is covered by very 
large dark brown- hued with lighter accent tiles. 
<br><br>
As you enter, there is a white ceramic wash basin topped by a mirror.  There 
is a partial wall between the wash basin and the urinal.  On this particular date 
there was a white paper sign over the urinal bowl not that it was not to be used. 
<br><br>
The commode is in a separate room, with floor-to-ceiling walls, and a white 
full louvered door.  In addition to the white ceramic commode, there is small dark 
wood cabinet to the right as you enter the room. 
<br><br>
There is a municipal parking lot behind the restaurant.
<br><br>

There have been a number of high-end restaurants in this space.  This is yet 
another one.  Hopefully, it will have better luck then its predecessors. 
<br><br>
Dinner at "adour" was Jo's suggestion and it was a good one. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is reached by walking past a separate bar and lounge area, 
which seems to draw a mix of hotel guests and locals. 
 <br><br>
The upholstery is white, and there are many windows that let in a great deal 
of light.  The room is cheery and bright.  At the near end of the room, there is a 
banquet with tables and regular chairs on the other side.  The chairs are 
comfortable. 
<br><br>
One of the nice things about this restaurant is that there are a number of 
relatively low calorie offerings. 
<br><br>
The meal began with an Amuse Bouche of puree potatos and tiny pieces of 
red sausage, served in a tiny earthen pot.  Different and tasty. 
<br><br>
Jo began with a Multicolor Spring Vegetable Composition, followed by a 
nice filet of Halibut with appropriate accompaniment. 
<br><br>
I started with a Chilled Marinated Shellfish.  As an entre I chose Baked 
Riviera Style John Dory with Baby Fennel, Basil and Taggiasche olive. 
<br><br>
We passed on ordering a specific dessert, but did enjoy a plate of tiny 
chocolates and cookies. 
<br><br>
There are 8 appetizers, 10 entrees, and specials of the day.  Also available is 
a cheese course and 7 desserts. 
<br><br>
On the evening we were at the restaurant, there was a tasting menu of 5 
courses. 
<br><br>
The service left nothing to be desired. 
<br><br>
As with any number of hotel-located restaurants, the restrooms are not 
conveniently located relative to the restaurant.  In this case you need to go out to 
the lobby and half way across it to find the sign that points to the Restrooms. 
<br><br>

You then face a fairly long, back and forth stairway to the level on which 
the restrooms are located.  (There is also an elevator available.) 
<br><br>
The restroom is quite nice as hotel and restaurant restrooms go. 
Immediately to the right, as you enter, there are several white ceramic urinals, 
which are separated by partial dark wooden panels that start about 2 feet off the 
floor and run to about 5 feet. 
<br><br>
Next come 4 commode stalls, enclosed by almost floor-to-ceiling dark wood 
walls and doors.  Across from the urinals and commodes are a string of 5 white 
ceramic washbasins in a tan marble counter with gold colored fixtures.  They are 
backed by a mirror that runs the length of the counter and fills the wall from the 
top of the counter to the ceiling. 
<br><br>
The floor, wall and ceiling are covered in various shades of tan. 
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, but in this economic climate you will not 
likely have any problems. 
<br><br>

                                 <b>All I Need To Know About David Souter</b>
<br><br>
In 1990, I had the privilege of being part of the team that prepared Supreme 
Court Justice David Souter for his confirmation hearing.  
<br><br>
In my view, he has been a supurb Justice, and has been surprising many 
with the tenor of his decisions. 
<br><br>
At the end of the Senate hearing the entire team had dinner with Souter. 
Other than briefly visiting the Court one day, I did not really see the Justice again 
for nearly 20 years, until November, 2007. 
<br><br>
As I sat in my living room surrounded by dear friends, either the night that 
Carol died or the night after, one of my friends came in to say that there was a 
well-dressed man in the front hall and it looked like Justice Souter. 
<br><br>
I went out to the hall and greeted Justice Souter.  He joined me for a while 
in the living room.  I don't remember what he said, but I remember that it made me 
feel good. 
<br><br>
That is all I need to know about David Souter.

I am told (not confirmed) that Freud said, 
<br><br>
"There are two main goals in life - To Love and To Work.

“Some who also work with the mind have added a third goal - To Play.

In 1999, Peter Hart Research conducted a ground breaking survey of some 
2000 adults, followed a decade later (2009), by a survey on the same subject of 
some 3000 adults.
<br><br>
The subject of the survey -- Michael S. Berman, your editor. 
<br><br>
1999 --16% of American adults, 32,147,117 people, knew me and had an 
opinion about me. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>7,890,656 had positive feelings about me </li>
<li>18% of respondents had negative feelings about me</li>
</ul>

2009 -- 28% of American adults, 61,082,000 people, know me and have an 
opinion about me. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>12,020,065 have positive feelings about me </li>
<li>only 5% have negative feelings about me</li> 
</ul>

In both surveys, 52% of women and 48% of men had positive feelings about 
me. 
<br><br>
[Note: My Google Alert has revealed that there are a number of Michael 
Bermans, and at least one more Michael S. Berman.  So it is possible that some of 
those who claim to know me actually know one of the other Michael Bermans.]

Questions to be considered in quiet moments.
<br><br>
Why does a round pizza come in a square box? 
<br><br>
How is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a good 
idea to put wheels on luggage? 
<br><br>
Why is it that people say they "slept like a baby," when babies wake up every two 
hours? 
<br><br>
Why do people pay to go up tall buildings and then put money in binoculars to 
look at things on the ground?

If you have yet to hear about "Twitter.com,"  you have certainly been 
exposed to this communication service if you have been paying attention to the 
news coming from Iran.  As the Iranian government began blocking ordinary 
communication channels out of the country, "tweeting" became the device that 
many American and other world news outlets are using to feed their reporting on 
the demonstrations, etc. 
<br><br>
As with Facebook, participation is free.  You signup at <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> and 
then you are able to list folks you would like to "follow."  Once you are following, 
you receive whatever information that person decides to send out.  The person you 
want to follow has to agree to allow you to follow him, her or it. 
<br><br>
Finding someone you are interested in following as a "tweeter" requires a 
little trial an error.  There is a place to search for a name, and once you get a hit, 
you can see who that person is following or who is following them.  You can then 
decide whether you want to follow one of those folks. 
<br><br>
I am following 18 people, and being followed by 20 people.  For example, I 
follow several news sources, like George Stephanopoulos, Jake Tapper and 
several other news services, like CNN. 
<br><br>
My name on Twitter is "<a href="http://twitter.com/mikesww">mikesww</a>." 
<br><br>
And you may find that people you have never heard of will decide to follow 
you. 
<br><br>
The limitation of each individual "tweet" is 140 characters, including 
spaces.  Your immediate reaction will be that you can't say anything meaningful in 
that short a message.  Give it a try and you will be surprised. . 
<br><br>
I have chosen to "tweet" things like: "Most pizzas are round; why are pizza 
boxes always square?"  Or my recent tweet:  "Why is it that we put men on the 
moon before we thought to put wheels on suitcases?" [<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/this_and_that_8.shtml">WW readers will recognize those items from the April WW</a>.] 
<br><br>
One caution -- information that you receive on Twitter is no better than the 
carefulness and reliability of the "tweeter."  It has been and will be used to mislead 
people.

Not everyone is an "early" adopter of the various forms of instant 
communication.  "Politico" reported the following from Congressman Barney 
Frank.  "The left and right live in parallel universes.  The right listens to talk radio, 
the left's on the internet, and they just reinforce one another. They have no sense 
of reality....I have now one ambition, to retire before it becomes essential to 
tweet."

In the first mid-term election of the last 9 Presidents tenure, 5 experienced 
their Party losing U.S. Senate seats.  [<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/2010_congressional_campaigns.shtml">See April, 2009 Washington Watch</a>]. 
<br><br>
At the moment, it appears that Democrats are likely to pick up Senate seats 
in 2010.  But it is not a sure thing. 
<br><br>
There is general agreement that the most vulnerable incumbent Democrat is 
Chris Dodd (D-CT).  For a variety of reasons, his support has plumeted, and he 
trails former Republican Congressman Rob Simmons in early polling.  However, 
in the most recent poll, Dodd trails Simmons by substantially less in earlier 
polling. 
<br><br>
One other complication for Dodd is that he is the Chair of the Banking 
Committee, faced with a need for reregulation of the financial community.  He is 
also the stand-in for Senator Kennedy as Chair of the Health, Education and Labor 
Committee, which has a key role in the healthcare debate. 
<br><br>
There are two potential problems from this dual role.  First, it is difficult to 
handle either of these Committees right now, and handling both of them raises the 
potential of not doing either very well.  Second, those dual responsibilities have to 
limit the amount of time he has to spend in Connecticutt. 
<br><br>
Going for Dodd is the fact that Obama won the state by 23 points. 
<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
There is little to say about the Illinois Senate race at this moment, except 
that the appointed Democratic incumbent will not be the nominee of the 
Democratic party.  Roland Burris (D-Il) did not have a distinguished entry into the 
office, and is not likely to distinguish himself while in the office.  It is not yet clear 
who the Democratic or Republican candidates will be, but it is hard to imagine 
losing the President's home seat unless his popularity has collapsed by November 
2010. 


<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

In Kentucky, the will he-or-won't-he run for re-election question about 
incumbent Jim Bunning (R-Ky) is so perplexing that even the riskiest of Wall 
Street Traders would not create a derivative based on the outcome. 
<br>
<br>
There are some interesting potential Democratic candidates but the fact 
remains that Obama lost the state by 17 points. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Missouri may provide one of the most interesting races of the 2010 season. 
Democratic Secretary of State, Robin Carnahan, is the putative Democratic 
candidate. 
<br>
<br>
On the Republican side, incumbent Kit Bond (R-MO) decided not to seek 
re-election.  The likely Republican candidate is Congressman Roy Blunt (R-MO). 
Blunt was #2 in the Republican House leadership through 2008, but decided not to 
seek re-election to that post in order to have the time to run for the Senate.  There 
is some suggestion that part of the impetus for his move was that Congressman 
Eric Cantor was planning to challenge him for the leadership role and the outcome 
was not clear. 
<br>
<br>
Obama had no special advantage in this state in the 2008 election. 
<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

With Senator Jud Gregg (R-NH) retiring, the New Hampshire seat is up for 
grabs.  The likely Democratic candidate is Congressman Paul Hodes.  On the 
Republican side, there are a number of possible candidates.  Obama won by 9 
points here, but this is still likely to be competitive. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

George Voinovich, (R-OH) is not seeking re-election, so Ohio becomes 
another open Senate seat in which the Democrats may have a slight advantage; 
however, it is far too early to be sure. 
<br>
<br>
Lee Fisher, the Democratic Lt. Governor, and Jennifer Brunner, the 
Democratic Secretary of State, are both in the queue at this point to be the 
Democratic nominee.  Both lead the putative Republican nominee, Rob Portman, 
who was many formers: former Congressman, former head of OMB, former 
USTR. 
<br>
<br>
Obama won the state by 4 points. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

There are two other potentially interesting races. 
<br>
<br>
In Delaware, Attorney General Beau Biden, currently serving in the military 
in Iraq, is expected to seek his father's vacated seat.  The toughest candidate 
against him appears to be Mike Castle (R-Del).  It is not clear that Castle will run. 
Polls taken early this spring suggest that Castle is favored over Biden.  Obama 
won the state by 25 points. 

<br>
<br>

And finally, the twists and turns of Pennsylvania.  Arlen Specter (used to be 
R-PA/now D-PA) ostensibly will face a primary against Congressman Joe Sestak 
(D-PA) on his way to a match with former Congressman Joe Toomey (R-PA). 
<br>
<br>
In early polls, Specter has a considerable lead over Sestak and a smaller lead 
over Toomey. 
<br>
<br>
Had he remained a Republican, Specter would be facing Toomey in the 
Republican primary. 
<br>
<br>
Obama won the state by 9 points.

If history is any indicator, Democrats can be expected to lose House seats in 
the 2010 election.  Starting with, and other than, Roosevelt in 1934 and Bush II in 
2002, the sitting President's Party has lost House seats in the mid-term election. 
[<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/2010_congressional_campaigns.shtml">See April 2009 Washington Watch for details</a>]. 
<br><br>
In the June Diego/Hotline poll, Democrats win the generic Congressional 
race 39-30.  In the previous month, The Democracy Corps survey recorded a 52- 
39 margin for the Democrats. 
<br><br>
Generic results are just that, generic, and are not good indicators of what 
might happen in truly competitive seats.  Charlie Cook points out that 49 
Democrats now hold seats that were won by McCain in 2008.  39 Republicans 
hold seats won by Obama.

                                 The healthcare system changes being pressed by Obama and being worked 
on by Congress, are a much bigger deal than anything else the President has 
proposed or is likely to propose during his Presidency. 
<br><br>
Let there be no question as to whether the public thinks something needs to 
be done about the current healthcare system.  34% think it is so broken that the 
whole thing needs to be rebuilt.  While another 51% think there is a need for 
fundamental change. 
<br><br>
And by a margin of 57% to 18% they think the Democratic Party is more 
likely than the Republican Party to improve the heathcare system.  [NYT/CBS 
6/09] 
<br><br>
The public is evenly divided on whether it thinks that the President's health 
care plan is a good one (33%/32%).  It is also evenly divided on whether the focus 
of healthcare reform should be on the "cost of healthcare" or "people who are not 
covered by insurance" (41%/43%).  They believe (64%/18%) that the focus of the 
President's plan is the uninsured.  [NBC/WSJ 6/09] 
<br><br>
Majorities believe everyone should be required to have health insurance 
coverage, some with government assistance (62%); 62% would raise taxes on 
people with incomes over $250,000/year; 55% would require all but small 
businesses to offer healthcare coverage or to pay the government to provide it. 
<br><br>
When asked a series of questions about the current healthcare system, 
Americans are dissatisfied with the system overall, but are generally comfortable 
with how the system works for them personally. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>57% are dissatisfied with the overall healthcare system </li>
<li>43% are satisfied </li>
<li>83% are satisfied with the healthcare they receive </li>
<li>81% are satisfied with their health insurance coverage </li>
<li>55% are satisfied with their healthcare costs, including cost of insurance and expenses not covered by insurance. </li>
<li>44% are dissatisfied. </li>
</ul>

[WP/ABC 6/09] 
<br><br>

People are split on whether payments by Medicare and Medicaid to doctors 
and hospitals should be reduced (47%/46%); 59% oppose requiring folks with 
expensive health plans to be required to pay taxes on a portion of the premium 
costs; and they are even more vigorously opposed (70%) to the idea of all people 
paying taxes on the cost of their private health insurnce plans.  [NBC/WSJ 6/09] 
<br><br>
One of the most contentious issues under discussion is whether there should 
be a so-called public option insurance plan administered by the federal 
government. This plan would compete with private insurance plans. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>72%  of all respondents favor a public plan (including 87% of Democrats) </li>

<li>57% are willing to pay higher taxes so that everyone can have healthcare; 37% oppose paying higher taxes</li> 

<li>54% are at least somewhat concerned that, if the government starts providing healthcare more broadly, the quality of their own care will deteriorate </li>

<li>34% are very concerned that their own access to medical tests and treatment would be more limited than now </li>

<li>a third believe they would be required to change doctors. </li>
</ul>
[NYT/CBS 6/09] 
<br><br>

In the June 2009 NBC/WSJ survey, 76% think it is quite important that 
there be a public plan administered by the government, even though 47% think it 
is at least somewhat likely that their employer will end their current health 
coverage. 
<br><br>
Those who support a public plan in the WP/ABC survey (62%) prefer to 
have an "independent organization" (41%) run the plan, rather than have a 
government agency do it (21%). 
<br><br>
If they think the public plan will force private health insurance companies to 
go out of business, a 37% plurality supports a private plan.  33% oppose it.

Even good results from healthcare reform can potentially have negative 
consequences. 
<br><br>
The Congressional Budget Office, in its recent estimate of the costs of 
certain healthcare proposals, noted the potential downsides of certain popular 
changes. 
<br><br>
According to an article in the Washington Post (6/18/09): 
<br><br>
"In some instances, the cost of delivering preventive care to a large 
population would actually exceed the savings on the relatively few people who 
avoided illness as a result." 
<br><br>
"....improving public health can reduce Medicare spending on particular 
problems.  However, helping people live longer and healthier lives will increase 
the burden they put on the federal government, partly because they will spend 
more time collecting Medicare and Social Security bnefits, the CBO reported."

If they figure out how to play their hand, the recommendations of doctors 
for reforming the healthcare system are likely to be most persuasive with the public.  73% have that view, as opposed to 58% who are confident in President 
Obama.  [Gallup 6/09] 
<br>
<br>
The availability of doctors, nurses, physicians assistants, nurse practioners, 
and related healthcare personnel is a subject that is not being given as much public 
attention as it should.  It is a problem that cannot be fixed in the short run. 
<br>
<br>
The biggest shortage is at the frontline of the healthcare system -- primary 
care doctors.  President Obama acknowledged the problem in his AMA speech. 
<br>
<br>
The Washington Post (6/20/09) said it quite succintly.  "Fifty years ago, half 
of the nation's doctors practiced what has come to be known as primary care. 
Today, almost 70 percent of doctors work in higher-paid specialties,,,." 
<br>
<br>
"By 2000, 14% of U.S. medical school graduates were entering family 
practice.  Five years later, the figure was 8 percent, and a recent survey of students 
interested in internal medicine showed that 98 percent wanted to become 
specialists." 
<br>
<br>
The availability of other critical healthcare and other personnel mentioned 
above is yet another story.

Postive feelings toward Obama have dropped only slightly since January -- 
66% to 60%.  However, negative feels have grown from 14% to 29%.  [NBC/WSJ 
6/09] 

<br><br>

In December 2008, the NBC/WSJ survey began asking respondents how 
strongly they relate to Obama as their President. 
<br><br>
The number who related to him has fallen somewhat, from 74% in January to 65% 
in June.

Interestingly, 58% believe that Obama is a new-style Democrat, who will be 
careful with the public's money.  36% say he is an old-style tax-and-spend 
Democrat.  [WP/ABC 6/09]

In February 84% thought Obama inherited the current economic conditions, 
while 8% saw him as responsible.  72% still believe he inherited these conditions, 
but now 14% hold him accountable.  [NBC/WSJ 6/09] 
<br><br>
The question for the Obama Administration is whether its various efforts to 
deal with the myriad financial problems will be effective before the lines cross and 
more people hold Obama accountable than believe he inherited the problems. 
<br><br>
At the present time, a plurality (48%) believe that Obama's policies have not 
yet had an effect on the economy.  32% believe that his policies have made things 
better, while 15% say he has made them worse.  [NYT/CBS 6/09] 
<br><br>
74% of Americans say they have heard at least something about the Federal 
budget deficit.  By 52% to 41% they believe the Government should spend money 
to reduce the deficit, rather than stimulating the economy.  And 60% to 30% they 
do not think the Obama Administration has developed a clear plan for dealing with 
the deficit.  [NYT/CBS 6/09] 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The public jury is out on whether the economic stimulus plan has helped or 
hurt the national economy.  28% say it has helped, 19% say it has hurt, and 52% 
say it has made no difference.  [WP/ABC 6/09] 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Some commentators have argued that Obama has taken on too many issues 
at the same time, and has effectively taken time and attention away from those 
issues that are most important.  60% of the public supports the proposition that he has taken on so many issues because the country has so many problems.  30% 
disagree.  [NBC/WSH 6/09] 
<br><br>
It does appear that Obama's programs are begining to face the legislative 
equivalent of Bernulli's principle.*  If you try to force too much legislation 
through the legislative pipeline at the same time, the process becomes clogged, 
either as a function of a lack of time or, more often, as a function of the 
interplay/collision of time and competing interests. 
<br><br>
Obama's apparent willingness to be flexible on what represents the 
accomplishment of his goals (there does not appear to be a my way or the highway 
attitude), will go a long way to making achievement of his goals possible. 
<br><br>
[*Bernulli's principle - if you force air through a straw faster and faster, eventually 
the straw becomes blocked and the air stops passing through.  Apparently, the 
speeding air going through the straw lowers the pressure and the outside air 
pressure closes off the far end of the straw.]

Between February 1976 and late October 2001, there was only one time 
(June 1983) when a majority (51%) of Americans trusted the government in 
Washington to do what is right, at least most of the time.  In late October 2001, 
55% trusted the government most of the time.  It has been down hill since then.  In 
October 2008, 83% said the government could be trusted to do what is right only 
some of the time.  In June 2009, 79% hold that view.

74% of those asked think it is at least somewhat important (43% very 
important) for the membership of the Supreme Court to  to reflect the gender, 
ethnic and racial makeup of the country as a whole.  62% of respondents believe 
that ,when voting on a Supreme Court nominee, the Senate should consider the

issues as abortion and affirmative action.  [NYT/CBS 6/09]

Americans think the government should continue to operate the prison.  However, 
if asked the very same question with the word "terrorists" substituted for 
"detainees," by 48% to 40% Americans believe it should be closed.  And, of those

For the first time since 1995 (when the question was first asked), a 
considerably larger number of people (51%) consider themselves "pro-life" then 
consider themselves to be "pro-choice." 
<br>
<br>
When the Gallup organization first began asking the question in mid-1995, 
only 33% described themselves as "pro-life," as opposed to 56% who described 
themselves as "pro-choice." 
<br>
<br>
In mid-2001 equal numbers (46%) described themselves as "pro-life" and 
"pro-choice." 
<br>
<br>
Questions have been raised as to whether this recent result, which reflected 
a substantial change from 2008, when 44% were "pro-life" and 50% pro-choice, 
resulted from a bad sample.  WW checked with the Gallup organization, in part to 
determine whether the Party split in this sample might be skewed.  Gallup is quite 
comfortable with the sample.
