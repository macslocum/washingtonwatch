This Sunday night dinner included Rita and Bob, Rhoda and Dan, Ron and 
me. 
<br><br>
The restaurant seats about 60 people, with a few additional tables on the 
sidewalk outside the restaurant.  Toward the back of the restaurant there is a small 
bar with 8 high chair/stools.  No one was at the bar on the night we were there. 
<br><br>
As I looked at my notes after the dinner, I had written "freshness."  There is 
a freshness and lightness about the place and the food. 
<br><br>
Rita started with a Salad of Lemon Marinated French Beans, Prosciutto and 
Shaved Parmesan with Walnut Balsamic Vinaigrette.  The rest of us were quite 
boring -- we all ordered gazpacho, which was the special that night and not on the 
printed menu. 
<br><br>
There was a little more adventure in the entree orders.  Rita and Rhoda 
ordered Pan Seared Barramundi with Lemon Gnocchi, Spinach, Exotic 
Mushrooms, Roasted  Tomatoes and Eggplant Couli. 
<br><br>
Ron opted for Sauteed Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Roasted Corn Hash 
and Sweet Corn Sauce.  The dish was designed to include Bacon Mashed Potatoes, 
but Ron chose an additional vegetable in its place. 
<br><br>
Dan ordered a Halibut special, and true to form Bob ordered the Oven 
Roasted Organic Chicken with Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Garden Vegetable 
Ragout.  Sticking with a fowl theme, I ordered Roasted Magret of Duck served 
Medium Rare with Sweet Potato and duck Confit Hash, Celery Root Galette and 
Foie Gras Reducation. 
<br><br>
We passed on offered desserts, but did enjoy a plate of cookies. 
<br><br>
The service was swift and excellent.  While the restaurant was not full when 
we were there, reservations are suggested. 
<br><br>
The men's room is of a size that no more than two people could use it at 
once.  It is likely to be the case that more often than not a single occupant will lock 
the outer door. 
<br><br>
It is well appointed and clean. 
<br><br>
All of the walls are a dark pinkish orange and the floor is covered by very 
large dark brown- hued with lighter accent tiles. 
<br><br>
As you enter, there is a white ceramic wash basin topped by a mirror.  There 
is a partial wall between the wash basin and the urinal.  On this particular date 
there was a white paper sign over the urinal bowl not that it was not to be used. 
<br><br>
The commode is in a separate room, with floor-to-ceiling walls, and a white 
full louvered door.  In addition to the white ceramic commode, there is small dark 
wood cabinet to the right as you enter the room. 
<br><br>
There is a municipal parking lot behind the restaurant.
