The public's attitude toward the job being done by the Congress is almost 
exactly opposite their view about the job being done by the President.  57% 
disapprove of the job being done by Congress (58% approve of the Preident - 
Gallup), while 29% approve.  This is about where the rating has been for most of 
the year.  [NBC/WSJ]

President Obama came to office with a Congress, which at least on the 
numbers, has more members of his Party seated than the most recent President 
Bush did at any time during his tenure.

In the first mid-term election of the last 9 Presidents tenure, 5 experienced 
their Party losing U.S. Senate seats.  [<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/2010_congressional_campaigns.shtml">See April, 2009 Washington Watch</a>]. 
<br><br>
At the moment, it appears that Democrats are likely to pick up Senate seats 
in 2010.  But it is not a sure thing. 
<br><br>
There is general agreement that the most vulnerable incumbent Democrat is 
Chris Dodd (D-CT).  For a variety of reasons, his support has plumeted, and he 
trails former Republican Congressman Rob Simmons in early polling.  However, 
in the most recent poll, Dodd trails Simmons by substantially less in earlier 
polling. 
<br><br>
One other complication for Dodd is that he is the Chair of the Banking 
Committee, faced with a need for reregulation of the financial community.  He is 
also the stand-in for Senator Kennedy as Chair of the Health, Education and Labor 
Committee, which has a key role in the healthcare debate. 
<br><br>
There are two potential problems from this dual role.  First, it is difficult to 
handle either of these Committees right now, and handling both of them raises the 
potential of not doing either very well.  Second, those dual responsibilities have to 
limit the amount of time he has to spend in Connecticutt. 
<br><br>
Going for Dodd is the fact that Obama won the state by 23 points. 
<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
There is little to say about the Illinois Senate race at this moment, except 
that the appointed Democratic incumbent will not be the nominee of the 
Democratic party.  Roland Burris (D-Il) did not have a distinguished entry into the 
office, and is not likely to distinguish himself while in the office.  It is not yet clear 
who the Democratic or Republican candidates will be, but it is hard to imagine 
losing the President's home seat unless his popularity has collapsed by November 
2010. 


<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

In Kentucky, the will he-or-won't-he run for re-election question about 
incumbent Jim Bunning (R-Ky) is so perplexing that even the riskiest of Wall 
Street Traders would not create a derivative based on the outcome. 
<br>
<br>
There are some interesting potential Democratic candidates but the fact 
remains that Obama lost the state by 17 points. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Missouri may provide one of the most interesting races of the 2010 season. 
Democratic Secretary of State, Robin Carnahan, is the putative Democratic 
candidate. 
<br>
<br>
On the Republican side, incumbent Kit Bond (R-MO) decided not to seek 
re-election.  The likely Republican candidate is Congressman Roy Blunt (R-MO). 
Blunt was #2 in the Republican House leadership through 2008, but decided not to 
seek re-election to that post in order to have the time to run for the Senate.  There 
is some suggestion that part of the impetus for his move was that Congressman 
Eric Cantor was planning to challenge him for the leadership role and the outcome 
was not clear. 
<br>
<br>
Obama had no special advantage in this state in the 2008 election. 
<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

With Senator Jud Gregg (R-NH) retiring, the New Hampshire seat is up for 
grabs.  The likely Democratic candidate is Congressman Paul Hodes.  On the 
Republican side, there are a number of possible candidates.  Obama won by 9 
points here, but this is still likely to be competitive. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

George Voinovich, (R-OH) is not seeking re-election, so Ohio becomes 
another open Senate seat in which the Democrats may have a slight advantage; 
however, it is far too early to be sure. 
<br>
<br>
Lee Fisher, the Democratic Lt. Governor, and Jennifer Brunner, the 
Democratic Secretary of State, are both in the queue at this point to be the 
Democratic nominee.  Both lead the putative Republican nominee, Rob Portman, 
who was many formers: former Congressman, former head of OMB, former 
USTR. 
<br>
<br>
Obama won the state by 4 points. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

There are two other potentially interesting races. 
<br>
<br>
In Delaware, Attorney General Beau Biden, currently serving in the military 
in Iraq, is expected to seek his father's vacated seat.  The toughest candidate 
against him appears to be Mike Castle (R-Del).  It is not clear that Castle will run. 
Polls taken early this spring suggest that Castle is favored over Biden.  Obama 
won the state by 25 points. 

<br>
<br>

And finally, the twists and turns of Pennsylvania.  Arlen Specter (used to be 
R-PA/now D-PA) ostensibly will face a primary against Congressman Joe Sestak 
(D-PA) on his way to a match with former Congressman Joe Toomey (R-PA). 
<br>
<br>
In early polls, Specter has a considerable lead over Sestak and a smaller lead 
over Toomey. 
<br>
<br>
Had he remained a Republican, Specter would be facing Toomey in the 
Republican primary. 
<br>
<br>
Obama won the state by 9 points.

Here is how the <u>37</u> Senate elections (18 Democratic

If history is any indicator, Democrats can be expected to lose House seats in 
the 2010 election.  Starting with, and other than, Roosevelt in 1934 and Bush II in 
2002, the sitting President's Party has lost House seats in the mid-term election. 
[<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/04/2010_congressional_campaigns.shtml">See April 2009 Washington Watch for details</a>]. 
<br><br>
In the June Diego/Hotline poll, Democrats win the generic Congressional 
race 39-30.  In the previous month, The Democracy Corps survey recorded a 52- 
39 margin for the Democrats. 
<br><br>
Generic results are just that, generic, and are not good indicators of what 
might happen in truly competitive seats.  Charlie Cook points out that 49 
Democrats now hold seats that were won by McCain in 2008.  39 Republicans 
hold seats won by Obama.
