There are three distinct dining areas, only two of which are available in the winter.
<br><br>
The main dining room seats about 70 people at tables of various sizes. There is also an L-shaped bar around which there are a number of traditional high bar stools. The back room seats about 35. During the summer months there is an outdoor covered deck which faces the street. It seats about 50.
<br><br>
During the period of a week I had dinner at the restaurant twice. First, with Jim, Van and Coleen, and then with Jim and Jamie.
<br><br>
The service was casual, but attentive, and the wait staff was ready to engage in conversation.
<br><br>
The menu is not large, but it is more than sufficient. There are 5 appetizers, 4 pizzas, 5 pastas, 8 entrees, and 9 desserts.
<br><br>
The food is solid with great ingredients, great tastes, and little pretense.
<br><br>
The first evening I started with Ketchum Grill Shrimp Cakes with Red Pepper Remoulade. The second visit, I had Summer Salad with Organic Baby Lettuce, raspberries, almonds and chevre.
<br><br>
I enjoyed a perfectly done Ketchum Grill Oven Roasted 1‚ÅÑ2 Chicken with herbs, spices and pan juices. The second night, I had Ketchum Grill Grilled Meatloaf Strawberry Mint Beef with tomato-currant chutney and Port wine.
<br><br>
One evening I treated myself to a Root Beer Float made with Henry Weinhard's Root Beer & Vanilla Ice Cream.
<br><br>
The men's room is relatively small. The floor is covered with large tan tiles and the walls are painted a light cream color. The door is painted green on the inside. There is a washbasin in a white marble top and a single white ceramic commode.
<br><br>
The restaurant has had many problems with the drainage of their toilets. In the men's restroom (I don't know about the women's restroom) the following was posted over the commode.
<br><br>
Hi Y'all. Did You Know that this Building is Nearly 125 years old? <br>
This toilet will serve you well. <br>
It can only Take Members of the "PEE" Family <br>
So only "Poo" Pee, "Tee" Pee and "Pea" Pee. <br>
Anything else can go in waste can to your right. Thanks,<br>
From All those who may have to go after <strong>you</strong>.
