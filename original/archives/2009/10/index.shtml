<h1>Chicken Out Rotisserie</h1>
Spring Valley, Washington, DC
</div>
I was delighted to find a new feature. It is called "chopp'd & toss'd", made to order salads or grilled wraps. I have not tried the wraps.
<br><br>
There is an order form on which you can make a series of choices.
<br><br>
Step 1 - Decide whether you want the salad chopp'd & toss'd or just toss'd.
<br><br>
Step 2 - Choose your greens from lettuce, spinach, romaine, and Asian Cabbage Mix.
<br><br>
Step 3 - Pick from a list of 21 vegetable and related items. The first 3 choices are free and any additional choices cost $.50 a piece.
<br><br>
Step 4 - Select items from an additional list of 13 cheeses, nuts, fruit. Each item costs $.75.
<br><br>
Step 5 - Select items from another list of 7 items that includes various forms of chicken and turkey. Each item costs $1.50.
<br><br>
Step 6 - Choose to have the dressing tossed or on the side. and then choose a dressing from a list of 8. including 2 fat free choices. No added charge.
<br><br>
Step 7 - Order other items like roast chicken, sandwiches, burgers, wraps. and a plethora of side dishes. My favorites are redskin mashed potatoes and chunk cinnamon applesauce.
<br><br>
Step 8 - Eat in or take it with you.
<br><br>
The ingredients seem fresh and I have had a number of excellent salads since I discovered this new offering.
<br><br>
The prices are right and the serving folks move right along. 
<br><br>
The restaurant I stop at is located in Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.

</div>
There are three distinct dining areas, only two of which are available in the winter.
<br><br>
The main dining room seats about 70 people at tables of various sizes. There is also an L-shaped bar around which there are a number of traditional high bar stools. The back room seats about 35. During the summer months there is an outdoor covered deck which faces the street. It seats about 50.
<br><br>
During the period of a week I had dinner at the restaurant twice. First, with Jim, Van and Coleen, and then with Jim and Jamie.
<br><br>
The service was casual, but attentive, and the wait staff was ready to engage in conversation.
<br><br>
The menu is not large, but it is more than sufficient. There are 5 appetizers, 4 pizzas, 5 pastas, 8 entrees, and 9 desserts.
<br><br>
The food is solid with great ingredients, great tastes, and little pretense.
<br><br>
The first evening I started with Ketchum Grill Shrimp Cakes with Red Pepper Remoulade. The second visit, I had Summer Salad with Organic Baby Lettuce, raspberries, almonds and chevre.
<br><br>
I enjoyed a perfectly done Ketchum Grill Oven Roasted 1⁄2 Chicken with herbs, spices and pan juices. The second night, I had Ketchum Grill Grilled Meatloaf Strawberry Mint Beef with tomato-currant chutney and Port wine.
<br><br>
One evening I treated myself to a Root Beer Float made with Henry Weinhard's Root Beer & Vanilla Ice Cream.
<br><br>
The men's room is relatively small. The floor is covered with large tan tiles and the walls are painted a light cream color. The door is painted green on the inside. There is a washbasin in a white marble top and a single white ceramic commode.
<br><br>
The restaurant has had many problems with the drainage of their toilets. In the men's restroom (I don't know about the women's restroom) the following was posted over the commode.
<br><br>
Hi Y'all. Did You Know that this Building is Nearly 125 years old? <br>
This toilet will serve you well. <br>
It can only Take Members of the "PEE" Family <br>
So only "Poo" Pee, "Tee" Pee and "Pea" Pee. <br>
Anything else can go in waste can to your right. Thanks,<br>
From All those who may have to go after <strong>you</strong>.

<strong>A question or two </strong>
<br><br>
When cheese gets its picture taken, what does it say? 
<br><br>
Why are a wise man and a wise guy opposites? 
<br><br>
Why do overlook and oversee mean opposite things? 
<br><br>
Why is the third hand on a watch called the second hand? 
<br><br>
Why do "slow down" and "slow up" mean the same thing? 
<br><br>
Why do "fat chance" and "slim chance" mean the same thing? 
<br><br>
Why do we sing "take me out to the ball game" when we are already there? 
<br><br>
Why is it called "after dark" when it really is "after light"?

                                 In its mid-September survey NBC/WSJ found 66% disapproving of the job being done by Congress, with 22% approving.
<br><br>
In a Gallup survey 10 days later, 72% of American disapproved of the way Congress is handling its job. The 21% who approve represent fewer supporters than at any time since January 2009, when 19% had that view.
<br><br>
The drop from a month ago, when 31% had a positive view of Congress, is driven almost exclusively by the fall-off in support from Democrats whose approval rating for Congress dropped from 54% to 36% over the period of 1 month.

<br><br>
While Democrats in Congress fare slightly better than Republicans, neither Party's legislators are doing well. In September the Democratic members scored at 36% and the Republicans at 27%. This has now dropped for both Parties. [Gallup 10/09]

For the 1st week of October, Gallup reports that the Democratic margin on the generic question (will you vote Democrat or Republican) was only 2 points, 46% - 44%. This is a substantial fall from the 54% - 39% Democratic margin just before the 2008 election. This is also down from a 6-point margin in July 2009.
<br><br>
The change is driven primarily by Independents. At the time of the 2008 election, they supported the Democratic candidates by 7 points, 46% - 39%. By July 2009, a shift had begun, and there was a 1-point margin for the Republican candidates. That margin has now widened to a 9-point advantage for Republican candidates, with the Republicans leading 45% - 36%. [Gallup 10/09]
<br><br>
Historically, Gallup has found that this generic question put to registered voters favors the Democrats by 4 or 5 points. This suggests that 2010 is likely to be a close election in the House.
<br><br>
On a related question, 49% say that a new person should be given a chance to be their representative in Congress, which is 4 points higher than it was before the November 2006 election, when the Democrats regained majority control of the body. [NBC/WSJ 9/09]

48 of the seats currently held by Democrats were won by George Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008. [<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/09/2010_congressional_campaigns_1.shtml">Information in last Washington Watch was incorrect</a>.]

Notwithstanding the fact that the problems facing the country do not seem to be getting much better, Americans still feel that Democrats, rather than Republicans, will do the best job of coping with the national problems over the next few years by 48% - 28%.

Mid-term elections are marked by at least two important characteristics.
<br><br>
First, in the last 4 general elections, voter turnout was 1/3 less than in Presidential election years than in mid-term elections. Or, said another way, the turnout in Presidential election years is 50% greater than mid-term elections.

Second, the composition of the electorate in mid-term elections skews older. President Obama lost the 45 years of age and up class by 2 points in 2008.

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

The 2010 Senate races are particularly critical for in 2012 and 2014 (combined) the Democrats have 39 seats in play, while the Republicans have 22 seats in play: 2012 - 20D/9R and 2014 - 19D/13R.
<br><br>
What was a question of how many additional seats the Democrats might pick up in the Senate in 2010, has now become a question of whether they will hold the present number of 58.
<br><br>
Since the last Washington Watch the number of Toss Up seats has grown from 7 to 10, with the Democratic seats in Delaware and Nevada added to that category (5D) and Texas added to the Republican total (5R).
<br><br>
In Delaware, the decision by long-term House Republican Mike Castle (R- DE) to enter the chase for the remaining 4 years of the term to which Vice President Biden was elected, moves the seat from the Safe Democrat to Toss Up category. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, who was earlier seen as likely to replace his father in the U.S. Senate, now faces a difficult choice. Should he run for the seat previously held by his father or instead go after the House seat being vacated by Castle.
<br><br>
Given Castle's age it is most likely that he will not run for re-election to a full term in 2014. Biden could relatively easily pick up the House seat and be in an excellent position to move to the Senate in 4 years. Or he could continue to serve as Attorney General, run for re-election when his current term ends in 2011, and then run for the Senate seat.
<br><br>
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is running behind two less well-known opponents in early general election matchups, although one underestimates Reid at ones peril. To further complicate the picture in Nevada, his son, Rory Reid, currently a Clark County Commissioner, is running for Governor. Given the complexion of the Nevada race it is too early to make a hard assessment of his prospects. Although, one observer, trusted by WW, says he does have a chance to be the next Governor.
<br><br>
The other race worth keeping an eye on at the moment is the NY Senate race (Kristin Gillibrand, D-NY). Gillibrand, who was appointed to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has resolved any issues concerning her nomination by the Democratic Party. She seems to be in pretty good shape in the general election, except if former Republican Governor George Pataki decides to make the race.

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 58 </li>
  <li> Republicans 40</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem) </li>
</ul>
    
    Here is how the <u>38</u> Senate elections (19 Democratic
incumbents, 19 Republican incumbents) look to me at this time (<u>underlining
reflects retirement</u>). (D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP
incumbent in office, I=Ind. incumbent in office) <br>

Using the <a href="http://www.cookpolitical.com">Cook Political Report</a> as the standard (slightly more optimistic than WW for the Democrats), Democrats have increased from 9 to 11 the number of races in the Solid Democrat column. There were as many as 13 in that group as recently as August. However, the number of Toss Up races in which Democrats are the incumbents has grown from 2 to 4.
<br><br>
The number of races in which the Republicans are currently in control has remained steady. There were 13 races in the Solid or Likely column in April and there are the same number today.

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>

It is roughly 12 months before the mid-term election, and anything can and will happen. Charlie Cook has suggested that as of now Democratic losses could result in Democrats losing control of the House. This would dramatically affect the ability of the House leadership to work its will in the next Congress.
<br><br>
As in the Senate races, the Cook Political Report House ratings show the number of races rated solidly Democratic has fallen steadily since April.	There are 21 fewer races ranked as solid in October as in April, 204 to 183. However, the number of races ranked solid or likely Democrat have only dropped by 4 races in that same time frame. The number of Democratically held Toss Ups has grown from 2 to 9.
<br><br>
The number of solid Republican races has fallen by 4, from 147 to 143. However, the number of races ranked solid or likely Republican has dropped by 9. The number of Republican Toss Ups has increased from 0 to 2.

                                 This past Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee passed out the so-called Baucus bill. Now the "fun" begins.
<br><br>
The "fun" in the Senate will take place in Majority Leader Harry Reid's conference room. Here will convene a small group of principals for the purpose of merging the Senate Finance Committee bill and the separate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee bill. This combined bill will then move to the Senate floor, probably the week of October 26th. The floor debate is expected to take 2 to 3 weeks.
<br><br>
The House will take its bill up in the last week of October or early in November. The Speaker has announced that it will be handled before Thanksgiving. Presumably, the House will want to act before the Senate is done so as to retain as much negotiating room as possible before the conference.
<br><br>
In a series of national polls taken during September approval of the President's handling of health care has ranged from 48% to 41%. Disapproval has ranged from 45% to 51%. [NBC/WSJ, CBS/NYT, CBS, WP/ABC, Gallup, Quinnipiac]
<br><br>
By 41% to 39%, Americans think the Obama plan is a bad idea, and by 36% to 19% they think quality will get worse rather than better. [NBC/WSJ 9/09]
<br><br>
47% believe that Obama will do a better job of handling healthcare than will Republicans in Congress. [Quinnipiac 9/09]
<br><br>
51% to 40% believe that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to guarantee health insurance for all Americans. [CBS/NYT 9/09]
<br><br>
50% believe that if the healthcare system is changed, the quality of their healthcare will remain the same. 32% think it will get worse. [WP/ABC 9/09]
<br><br>
80% of Americans are "satisfied" (39% very satisfied) with the quality of their medical care. Only 61% are satisfied (20% very satisfied) with the cost of medical care.
<br><br>
37% are at all confident, and another 19% are not confident that the President's plan can be paid for with cuts in Medicare and other parts of the existing healthcare system.
<br><br>
There is no stomach among the vast majority of Americans (78% - 85%) for a healthcare reform plan that would raise taxes on the middle class, cause middle-class Americans to pay more for healthcare, restrict the doctors they could see or the medical treatments that might be available, or that the quality of health care for middle-class Americans would get worse. [Gallup 9/09]
<br><br>
Those who have made up their minds about the need for a healthcare bill favor its passage by 40% to 36%. When "leaners" are included in the tally, 51% favor passage, while 41% oppose. [Gallup 10/09]
<br><br>
Folks are roughly even, 38% to 40%, on whether they would advise their member of Congress to vote for or against the bill. Only among those 18-29 years old is there a plurality that would advise their member of Congress to vote for a healthcare bill. The older you are, the less likely you are to advise your

Here is another example of the relevance of the wording of a question.
<br><br>
When asked whether or not it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to make sure that all Americans have healthcare coverage – by 54% to 41% – they say yes.
<br><br>
When asked separately whether the Federal Government or <strong>Americans themselves</strong> should be primarily responsible for making sure their families have health insurance – by 61% to 37% – they say Americans themselves should be responsible.

In some ways, the job approval rating number is a relatively sensitive measurement. Consider the following from Gallup surveys:

Approval from Democrats was constant at 84%. However, job approval from Independents jumped from 46% to 55%. Among Republicans it jumped from 12% to 20%. What happened that might account for the change? Obama was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace.
<br><br>
Obama is tied for 5th/6th/7th of 9 when his overall job approval rating is matched up with other modern Presidents' ratings at the same point (October) in the first terms after they were elected. [Gallup surveys]

On his handling of the economy, the NBC/WSJ and the CBS/NYT surveys in mid-September gave him a 50% approval rating, with disapproval being 40% in the one and 42% in the other.
<br><br>
As to his handling of foreign policy, the NBC/WSJ survey showed him with a 50% approval rating and a 36% disapproval rating. On specific foreign policy issues, the CBS/NYT survey showed him with a 54% approval rating on his handling of Iraq, but only a 44% approval rating on Afghanistan. Disapproval of his handling of Iraq was at 29% and Afghanistan was 35%. [mid-September for both surveys].

Further strengthening the President's hand is that the public still trusts the President more than Republicans in Congress to handle the economy (48%-37%); healthcare (48%-36%); and the Federal budget deficit 50%-36%). [WP/ABC 9/09]
<br><br>
In April 54% said the President was doing a better job than they expected, while 18% held a contrary view – a 36-point spread. In September 42% said he was doing a better job, while 31% thought he was doing worse than expected – an 11-point spread. [WP/ABC]

A substantial number of people (60%) still believe that Obama has made a "sincere effort" to work with the Republicans in Congress. That number has been on a steady decline since it was recorded at 80% before his inauguration. The number who say he has not made a sincere effort has grown from 19% to 38%. [Gallup]

The President is facing a difficult set of choices as he contemplates the country's future policy toward Afghanistan. The public seems to be shifting in its views. In the 4th week of September Americans opposed sending more troops to Afghanistan by 50% - 41%. But by the end of the first week in October there had been a slight shift and sending more troops was favored by 48% - 45%.
<br><br>
The reason that 80% of respondents say is the most important reason for keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan is to "weaken terrorists’ ability to stage attacks on the United States." 55% believe that progress is being made in that regard.
<br><br>
In June 50% of the Afghans approved of U.S. leadership, while 42% disapproved. [Gallup 9/09]

National unemployment hit 9.8% in September, with experts predicting that it will hit 10.5% in 2010, before topping out.	When those who are underemployed or are no longer looking are taken into account, the effective unemployment rate is probably 17-18%.

<br><br>
263,000 jobs were lost in September and a total of 5.6 million jobs were lost in the year ending March 31, 2009.
<br><br>
39% of people who are self-employed are completely satisfied with their jobs. This is only true of 22% are not self-employed.	[Pew 9/09]

When respondents were offered the opportunity to answer an open-ended question about “what is the most important problem facing the country today," 3 issues break into double digits.

Of note is that the economy/jobs, which scored at 61% in January, now only head the list for 41% of us. On the other hand, healthcare has jumped up substantially, most likely driven by the healthcare reform debate rather than an underlying concern about the subject.

45% of Americans believe that there is too much government regulation of business and industry.	27% say there is the right amount of such regulation, and 24% say there is too little.
<br><br>
70% of Americans are of the view that at least 26% of every dollar collected by the Federal Government is wasted. Half that number believe that 51% or more of every dollar is wasted.	[Gallup 9/09]

Those who identify as <strong>Democrats/Democratic-leaning independents</strong> and those who identify as Republicans/Republican-leaning independents are roughly equal in number to what they were in early 2005.
<br><br>
There was not a Democratic or leaners margin in 2005. The margin in the 3rd quarter of 2009 was 6 points for the Democrats and leaners.
<br><br>
The high points for Democrats and leaners was a 14-point margin during the 4th quarter of 2006 and the 1st quarter of 2008, and a 13-point margin in January 2009. There was no time during this 5 year period when Republicans and leaners enjoyed a positive margin.
<br><br>
However, in terms of those who identify <strong>only</strong> as Democrats or Republicans (without leaners), there was a 2-point margin for the Republicans in 2005, which has grown to a 8-point margin for the Democrats in 2009.

While the Democratic Party is seen favorably by 51% of Americans, only 40% have that view of the Republican Party. That margin is only 4 points among men ,but 17 points among women.	[Gallup 9/09]

45% of Americans have a great deal or fair amount of "trust and confidence" that the news will be reported accurately and fairly by the mass media – newspapers, TV and radio. In 1999 that number was 55%.	18% do not trust the media.
<br><br>
By 45% to 15% these respondents think the media is too liberal versus too conservative. It will come as no surprise that Republicans see the media as being biased (74%) on the liberal side, while 53% of Democrats see the media as being just about right.	45% of Independents hold the "too liberal" view.
<br><br>
About 36% follow national political news very closely. This group includes 41% of Republicans, 37% of Independents, and 30% of Democrats. Men at 42% are more attentive than women at 30% in the "follow very closely" group. [Gallup 9 & 10/09]

There has been a rather dramatic change in attitudes on two historically contentious issues over the past 15+ years, abortion and gun control.
<br><br>
Over the last 15 years the number of people who identify themselves as pro- life or pro-choice has changed substantially. In 1996, 56% of Americans described themselves pro-choice. Now that number is 46%. Perhaps of even more impact, 47% now describe themselves as pro-life, up from 33% in 1996. The spread between the two options was as great as 11 points in May of this year.
<br><br>
Of further interest is that Catholics and non-Catholics are identical in their view of the "moral acceptability" of abortion. 40% of Catholics and 41% of non- Catholics find abortion to be morally acceptable. [Gallup 8 & 3/09]
<br><br>
Another major change over the last 18 years is public attitudes toward gun control laws. There has been a dramatic shift in the number of folks supporting more strict laws.
