<h1>Ben's Chili Bowl</h1>

It is 7:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. You have eaten carefully for days on end; chicken, fish, veggies and fruit, little or no added fat.
<br><br>
Suddenly, you have an unquenchable "thirst" for an old fashioned, artery- clogging, bacon and egg sandwich. You know there are a variety of restaurants in which you can get this treat. But as long as you are going to treat yourself you might as well go for the best.
<br><br>
So, I headed to <strong>Ben's Chili Bowl</strong>.
<br><br>
At 7:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning, there were no lines and there were available seats at the counter. I opted to take the sandwich home with me.
<br><br>
I am savoring it as I write this note. Freshly scrambled whole eggs, with gobs of bacon that was cooked some time earlier and is sitting, partially curled, in a metal pan which is kept warm, and bread covered with butter.
<br><br>
There are a variety of breakfast sandwiches in just about every combination of eggs from scrapple to salmon cakes. And there is French toast and hotcakes.
<br><br>
Subsequent to my breakfast foray I attended an event at the Lincoln Theater which is next door to the Chili Bowl. During the cocktail hour one of the items passed were minature chili dogs, the treat for which Ben's is particularly well known. Ambrosia is probably the wrong word, but it is close.
<br><br>
Breakfast is served starting at 6:00 a.m. Monday - Friday and 7:00 a.m. on Saturday. It ends at 10:45 a.m. Breakfast is not served on Sunday.<br><br>
