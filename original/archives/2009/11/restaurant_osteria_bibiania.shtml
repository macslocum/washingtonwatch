I first visited Bibiania with Marcia and Fred. I look forward to returning.
<br><br>
As you enter, there is a host stand, and directly behind the stand is a long, straight bar with about 16 high chairs. Behind the bar are open areas that allow you to look into the working kitchen.
<br><br>
Directly to the right of the entry dining room there is a cozy seating area that holds a dozen or more people for drinks and socializing.
<br><br>
There are two dining rooms. The one to the left of the entry way seats about 50 in 4s and 2s. It is sometimes used for private parties.
<br><br>
The dining room to the right seats 70. There is a half-wall separating the room from the entry way. Along that half-wall there is a padded bench which is used for seating at a series of tables. There is a private area at the far side of this dining room that looks to seat up to 10 people. The area is separated from the rest of the room by a gauzy curtain.
<br><br>
The dining room to the right, in which our table was located, was quite noisy, but we were able to hear ourselves think and to hear each other.
<br><br>
There are large black and white photographs scattered about the restaurant and the men's room. The dominant decorating material throughout the restaurant appears to be chrome.
<br><br>
We began our meal by sharing a series of Piatti (appetizers): 
<br><br>
Arancini (Saffron Rice Fritters, Parmigiano) <br>
Baccala (Salted Cod Fritters,Pil-Pil) <br>
Polpettine (Veal Meat Balls in Sugo Finto) <br>
Carciofi (Artichoke Guidea)<br>
Pomodor (Heirlook Tomato Salad) 
<br><br>
There are 4 pieces of each of these treats.
<br><br>
For her main course, Marcia chose Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese (Tagliatelle with traditional bolognes,Ragu). Fred and I chose the same entree, Razza (Seared Skate, little neck clams, cauliflower,brown butter).
<br><br>
I was alone in ordering dessert, each of 3 available flavors of gelatto. They were served in an interesting fashion, The flavors were layered in a glass that had the appearance of a short clear drinking glass. It was easy to spoon out all 3 flavors at the same time.
<br><br>
The service was fast and attentive, even though the restaurant was quite full. Our serving person was particularly friendly. He remembered me from another restaurant at which he had worked.
<br><br>
The men's room has a bright red wall on the right as you enter. To the left are two large round white ceramic cylyndrical wash basins standing about 3 feet deep with a large mirror behind them.<br><br>

In most men's rooms there are one or two urinals that are relatively out in the open, easily visible. In this restroom there was no urinal in the open. There are 3 small "rooms," completely enclosed from floor to ceiling with full size doors. The doors and walls are heavy, dark wood. In each of the 2 narrower "rooms" there is a urinal. In the larger "room" there is a white ceramic commode. There is also a large picture above the commode.
<br><br>
The walls, other than the red wall, are painted in a very dark color, and the floors are totally covered with a dark material that appears to be planks laid end- to-end in rows.
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended. There is valet parking at the H Street entrance to the restaurant.<br><br>
