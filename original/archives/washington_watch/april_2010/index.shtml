<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2010/04/state_of_the_nation_13.shtml">State of the Nation</a></h3>

<p>Public opinion as to whether the country is headed in the right direction or is on the wrong track is static since December. In the NBC/WSJ poll, the wrong track number continues to edge up, while the right direction number...</p>
