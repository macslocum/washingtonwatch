<p>The Winston Group recently made the following point. Of the 48% who rated the economy as “not so good” in 2014, 58% voted Republican and 41% voted Democrat, a spread of 17 points in favor of the Republicans. In 2012,...</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2014/12/president_obama_34.shtml">President Obama</a></h3>

<p>The public’s grade on President Obama’s job approval (as found by Gallup 12/6) is 43% approval/51% disapproval. The NBC/WSJ survey found the President’s job approval at 44%, up a smidgen from a year earlier. Americans’ approval of how Obama is...</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2014/12/congress.shtml">Congress</a></h3>

<p>53% of us want the Republicans in Congress, rather than President Obama, to have the most influence over the direction of the nation in the next year. Early in 2012 Obama was chosen by a margin of 46% to 42%....</p>

<p>This is the current list of potential contenders. Inclusion on this list requires very little connection to an actual intention to run for President. For example, if someone suggests publicly that you should or might be a candidate and you...</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2014/12/this_and_that_17.shtml">This and That</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2014/12/do_you_need_a_numi.shtml">Do you need a Numi?</a></h3>

<p>As regular readers of the Watch know, most of the Watch’s restaurant reviews include comments about the restroom. This fixation on the quality of the restrooms led Debbie to suggest that she wanted to buy a Numi for me. The...</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2014/12/restaurant_giovanni_ristorante.shtml">Restaurant: Giovanni Ristorante</a></h3>

<p><em>Beechwood, Ohio:</em> The restaurant is interesting for a number of reasons besides the food. Most of the guests appeared to be regulars. And, there was a whole lot of kissing going on between the manger and serving people and the guests, particularly those seated at the bar.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2014/12/restaurant_shanghai_lounge.shtml">Restaurant: Shanghai Lounge</a></h3>

<p><em>Washington, DC:</em> This is a very small, two-story restaurant. On the main floor there is a kitchen at the back of the restaurant. Just forward of that important feature is a small bar with five high stools.</p>
