<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_barbuto.shtml">Restaurant: Barbuto</a></h3>

<p><i>New York, NY</i>: The menu changes every day.  On the day we were there for lunch the menu included a mix of items that made it possible to select items that are more traditionally eaten at breakfast</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_acquerello.shtml">Restaurant: Acquerello</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: The service was exceptional.  There appear to be 3 captains working the floor, including the owner and his son, as well as a serving person. </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_curbside_cafe.shtml">Restaurant: Curbside Cafe</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: There was one serving person who handled all of the action from greeting folks to taking orders and delivering up the food.   He was in perpetual motion. However, when he was attending to a given customer he was attentive and unhurried. </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_innout_burger.shtml">Restaurant: In-N-Out Burger</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: According to a friend, if you don't order an In-N-Out burger  in a certain way, you make it very clear to everyone that you are not "In-N-Out Burger sophisticated." </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_roccos_cafe.shtml">Restaurant: Rocco's Cafe</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: This is a neighborhood joint that Stanley selected for my first breakfast in San Francisco. The place looks like it has been there for decades, but at least this location opened in 1990. </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_mamas.shtml">Restaurant: Mama's on Washington Square</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: If you decide to try Mama's, which WW recommends that you do, wear comfortable shoes; it is inevitable that you will spend some time waiting in line.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_the_slanted_door.shtml">Restaurant: The Slanted Door</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: This 175 seat restaurant describes itself as Vietnamese, but is probably better described as Pan Asian. </p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/theater_review_beach_blanket_b.shtml">Theater Review: Beach Blanket Babylon</a></h3>

<p><i>San Francisco</i>: There is no way to describe this show, except to say that all 5 of us laughed or giggled pretty much non-stop throughout the 90-minute performance. </p>
