<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/state_of_the_nation_33.shtml">State of the Nation</a></h3>

<p>The NBC/WSJ [6/2/13] found that 59%of Americans believe that things are on the wrong track in this country. The same result was reported by the CBS/NYT [6/4/13] . 24% are satisfied with the way things are going in this country....</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/president_obama_23.shtml">President Obama</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_matchbox.shtml">Restaurant: Matchbox</a></h3>

<p><em>Washington, DC:</em> One of the nice features of the matchbox menu is that there are several appetizers and salads, and all of the pizzas can be ordered in a smaller or larger size.
</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_zaytinya.shtml">Restaurant: Zaytinya</a></h3>

<p><em>Washington, DC:</em> The crowd ranges from quite young to those of us on the older side. Dress is absolutely casual. The restaurant is rather noisy, but not cacophonous.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_zengo.shtml">Restaurant: Zengo</a></h3>

<p><em>Washington, DC:</em> The restaurant is a two story affair. On the main floor, as you enter, there is a reception desk near the front door. Proceed into the restaurant and there is a bar with high stools and a number of small, tall tables. The principal dining area is up a long flight of stairs. Happily, there is an elevator.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_range_2.shtml">Restaurant: Range</a></h3>

<p><em>Washington, DC:</em> A reader noted that the review of Range did not include a recitation of what Gail, Rob, Debbie and I ate. Nor did it include the usual rest room review. I have no idea why I did not include this information.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_jean_georges_steak.shtml">Restaurant: Jean Georges Steak House</a></h3>

<p><em>Las Vegas, Nev:</em> Through a certain amount of subterfuge Rita arranged for the group to get a perfectly-sized private room. The centerpiece of the room was two chandeliers, each of which were constructed of utensils, knives, forks, and spoons hanging from an oval frame.
</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_nobu.shtml">Restaurant: Nobu</a></h3>

<p><em>Las Vegas, Nev:</em> The restaurant is very large, but broken up in a variety of ways. There are a number of round tables that seat up to ten people, most of which are in round alcoves.</p>
			
				
<h3><a href="https://original.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/06/restaurant_american_fish.shtml">Restaurant: American Fish</a></h3>

<p><em>Las Vegas, Nev:</em> The restaurant has several rows of booths, and then a variety of two, four, six, eight and ten-person tables. The ten of us were again seated at a round table.</p>
