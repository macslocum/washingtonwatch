</div>Peggy, Debbie and I went to Spruce for lunch, at Peggy’s suggestion.
<br><br>
The restaurant is quite bright, even though it seems that every possible surface is done in black.	The ceilings are very high, and there is a center island that is both a bar with about a dozen seats and a visible wine cellar.	The chairs are
extraordinarily comfortable.	The main restaurant seats about 85, and there are a couple of private rooms that seat up to 20 and up to 40 respectively.
<br><br>
The restaurant prides itself on its always fresh ingredients from local farms and ranches.	As an interesting benefit to its customers, from 3:30-5:30 p.m. on Thursdays Spruce operates a farmers’ market.	This is done in partnership with County Line Harvest, a provider operated by a number of farmers.	Subject to availability, the farmers’ market sells a box of selected fresh fruits and vegetables at a cost of $25.	If you want to be certain of availability, it is recommended that you pre-order.
<br><br>
Peggy ordered a French Omelet with Parmesan Broth, Spigarello and Brie De Nangis.	Debbie selected Fisherman’s Mussels and Garlic Crostone.	I ordered a Beef Tongue appetizer and Saffron Fazzoletti, Braised Rabbit, Lentils and Carrots. For dessert we shared an order of Beignets and Chocolate Ice Cream.
<br><br>
The service was a little odd.	Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The whole place has a cheery tone.	One of our party mentioned to our serving person that whatever she ate had to be gluten free.	A few moments later, a person other than our server brought us an amuse boche and specifically mentioned that it was gluten free indicating that our server had passed on that information.
<br><br>
On the other hand, as noted, I ordered an appetizer of beef tongue.	I was the only one who ordered a starter.	It did not come and it did not come.	I decided that I would not remind the server.	And then our entrees arrived and it still had not come.	I mentioned it to the server, who was very apologetic, and then it still took a particularly long time for several excellent slices of beef tongue to show up at our table.	I am sure it tasted as good after my entrée as it would have tasted before.
<br><br>
You enter the men’s room through a heavy black wood door with a large, waist high, opaque window.	The floor is covered with large grey/white tiles. There are two wash basins in a heavy grey/white marble with a very large mirror over the wash basins.	The walls are covered, floor to ceiling, by large white tinged marble tiles.	There is a large, fully-enclosed commode room with one strategically placed wall bar.	In the open part of the room there is a large, comfortable chair similar to those in the dining room.
<br><br>
They provide valet parking after 5:00 p.m.
