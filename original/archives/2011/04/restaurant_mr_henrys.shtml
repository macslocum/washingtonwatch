<h1>Mr. Henry’s Restaurant</h1>
601 Pennsylvania Ave SE<br>
Washington, DC<br>
202-546-8412</div>I went to Mr. Henry’s with Hilary and Debbie on a Friday night, at Hilary’s suggestion.	There were more patrons fitted into the main floor dining room than in any restaurant at which I have ever eaten.	The second floor is also available, and there is a sidewalk dining area when weather permits.
<br><br>
When we entered the restaurant no one made any pretense about directing us to a table.	You are on your own.	Hilary, who knew the drill, spotted what must have been the last three chairs in the room.	We literally stuffed ourselves into the space.
<br><br>
Friday is Fried Chicken night at Mr. Henry’s -- 1⁄2 Fried Chicken with French Fries (or other potatoes) and cole slaw.	All three of us ordered the fried chicken.	It was the best fried chicken I have ever eaten.	I ate all of my order and part of Debbie’s.
<br><br>
Every night at Mr. Henry’s delivers some kind of special.	For example, on Wednesdays, it is Marta’s Meatloaf.	In addition to the specials, the menu is extensive.	There are nine beef burgers, as well as a vegetable burger, a turkey burger, and a mushroom burger.
<br><br>
There are a passel of starters and sides that will meet any taste.	They ranged from an Artichoke Dip to a Fried Clam Basket.
<br><br>
I counted eleven “platters” on the menu.	An example is the Dog Dinner, a quarter-pound Kosher dog with sauerkraut & French fries.	The variety of sandwiches would meet any taste.	Consider the Grilled Vegetarian on Rye with Cheddar cheese, tomato, onion, fresh spinach, and mushrooms.
<br><br>
The servers were busier than any I have seen in any restaurant, but totally accommodating.
<br><br>
The men’s room was serviceable, but not a place in which you would want to hang out.
<br><br>
Parking is catch-as-catch can and not easy.	Consider taking the Metro: Blue Line to the Eastern Market station.
