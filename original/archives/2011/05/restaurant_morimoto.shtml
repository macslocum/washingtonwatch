					<h3><a href="#">Restaurant: Morimoto</a></h3>

<p></p>
We went to two, quite different, restaurants on successive nights in Napa – Morimoto and Bistro Jeanty.	They were different as to type of food, décor and
“scene.” Both were worth the evening we spent there.
<br><br>
<div class="restaurant-box">
<h1>Morimoto</h1>
610 Main Street<br>
Napa, California 94559<br>
702-252-1600<br>
<a href="http://www.morimotoapa.com">www.morimotoapa.com</a><br>
<a href="mailto:info@morimotoapa.com">info@morimotoapa.com</a></div>Peggy and Mike suggested that we have dinner at Morimoto, a restaurant that offers contemporary Japanese cuisine.
<br><br>
The restaurant is quite large and very modern in design.	As you enter there is a regular seating area to the right, and as you head further into the restaurant there is a large open kitchen on the right.	You can stop and watch the kitchen in action, but there is a lot of traffic as dishes are conveyed from the kitchen to diners.
<br><br>
The back of the restaurant is divided into two large rooms that are essentially open one to the other.	In the area you first enter there is a large bar to the left and a comfortable seating area to the right.	Folks that are either in the restaurant for a drink or waiting for a table hang out in this area.	By the time we left it was quite crowded.	The back end of this first room holds a number of tables that seat 4 or more.
<br><br>
We were led through the first room and into the second where we were seated.
<br><br>
My notes for the evening are less than perfect.	On the appetizer front I ordered sushi and I had a tempura calamari salad.	I think Peggy passed and I did not record Debbie’s choice.	For entrees, Peggy chose sushi and sashimi; Debbie selected the whole roasted lobster ‘epice’; I went with the black cod, working my way through a crispy whole fish.	Each of the cooked dishes had unique tastes that made them particularly enjoyable.
<br><br>
The service was excellent.
<br><br>
The whole place is a bit of a scene and at least on this weekend night, it was very loud.	So loud, in fact, that holding a conversation was somewhat difficult. The cliental trends young and well off.
<br><br>
The restroom fit the modern style of the restaurant.
