<a href="mailto:therichmond@sbcglobal.net">therichmond@sbcglobal.net</a></div>Debbie and I went to The Richmond with Howard and Jackie. This is a relatively small neighborhood restaurant.	Our table was by itself, in a corner to the right of the entrance.	Straight ahead is a small bar with 6 tall chairs.	Another 4-top is snuggled in next to the bar.	Then, in a small room to the left, there are six tables which seat a total of 20 people.	There is draping in various places around the restaurant to provide a certain amount of privacy.
<br><br>
Jackie and Debbie started with the Harvest Salad & Pear Vinaigrette (mixed greens, poached pears, candied walnuts, dried cranberries & blue cheese).	Howard had Potato Leek soup, and I savored the Roast Beets & Cardamon Carrot Salad topped with Laura Chenel goat cheese in phyllo pastry.
<br><br>
Jackie ordered Boneless Pan-Fried Chicken, substituting vegetables for what was offered with the chicken â€“ baked Rigatoni & meat sauce.	Debbie went for a Bone-in Pork Chop with potato puree & mushroom sauce.	Howard selected the Seared File with Wild Mushrooms, substituting polenta for potato hash.	I also picked the Pan Fried Chicken, substituting potato for the Rigatoni.
<br><br>
The restroom is quite small.	There is barely enough room to turn around.	A tiny triangle-shaped wash basin adorns the corner opposite the commode.	The floor is covered with large grayish tiles.	Smaller off-white tiles cover the walls to shoulder height.	Above the tiles, the wall and ceiling are painted red.	Above the commode hangs a framed front page of the San Francisco Chronicle from the 1980s when the 49ers won the Super Bowl.
<br><br>
The service left nothing to be desired.
<br><br>
Parking is a bit problematic because there is no obvious parking lot and the curbs are occupied by neighborhood cars.
