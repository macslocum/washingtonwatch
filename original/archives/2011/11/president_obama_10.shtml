					<h3><a href="#">President Obama</a></h3>

<p></p>
The most recent NBC/WSJ survey found that 71% of Americans say they like President Obama personally, and 45% have favorable feelings about the President, while 40% have unfavorable feelings about the President.
<br><br>
The best description I have seen of public attitudes toward President Obama was written by Peter Hart in a recent memorandum following the most recent NBC/WSJ survey.
<br><br>
“His image lacks the clarity that most presidents have by this time (Reagan “strength and optimism,” Clinton “compassion and determination,” and Bush 43 “conviction.”) This president does not emerge with a central image or core set of values to the voters.”
<br><br>
Other commentary on the President can be summed up this way: people like the President, but they are not sure he is up to the job.

The President’s job approval rating seems to have settled in at 44% approving. He now ranks 8th of 9, when matched against the previous 8 Presidents at this point of their 3rd year in office. [Based on Gallup surveys]

On the issue that is most important to the public, the economy, the President’s performance is disapproved by 57% to 40%. Conversely, on foreign policy, the job he is doing is approved by 52% to 41%. Only 10% think that Obama has done better in office than expected. 35% say he has done worse than expected. [NBC/WSJ 11/11]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>


On several other issues the President’s performance rating is in negative territory. These include healthcare, on which 55% disapprove of his work, and the handling of the Federal budget deficit, where his negative rating is 67%.
<br><br>
For the first time, a majority of Americans, 53%, blame Obama for the state of the U.S. economy. However, 69% still blame President Bush for this circumstance.
<br><br>
43% believe that Obama has been a better President than George W. Bush. 34% say he is worse than Bush. However, among Independents 33% believe Obama is a better President than Bush, but 38% think he is worse. 50% believe Obama is a worse President than Bill Clinton.
<br><br>
As a “team,” 67% of Americans think the President and the current Ccongress are doing a bad job. [Gallup 9/11]
<br><br>
When assessing blame for not finding solutions to the problems facing the country, the President is blamed by 36% of the public, while the Democrats in Congress receive 47% of the blame. 55% blame the Republicans in Congress. [NBC/WSJ 11/11]

The next twelve months will be a time of high tension for the President and his team. It will test their mettle.
