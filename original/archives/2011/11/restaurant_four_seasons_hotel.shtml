<h1>Four Seasons Hotel</h1>
2800 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
Washington, DC 20007<br>
202-342-0444<br>
Fax 202-944-2075</div>For those of you who are devotees of the Seasons Restaurant on the first floor below the lobby (as opposed to Bourbon Steak on the lobby floor), that room will be temporarily closed beginning on December 19, 2011. The room is being refreshed/renovated. WW has been assured that the tables, while different, will be located in the same places within the room. However, the new tables will not be covered with the cloths and skirts that are now used. WW was not able to confirm the style or comfort of the new chairs.
<br><br>
The room is scheduled to re-open in early February.
<br><br>
If you are a regular, the Christmas brunch will, for this year, be located in Bourbon Steak, with a special a la carte menu as opposed to the multi-station brunch of the past. During the renovation period the regular Sunday brunches will also feature a la carte selections from a special menu. Hopefully, once the refreshing has been completed and the Seasons is again open, the brunch food stations will return.
<br><br>
The men’s restroom on the Seasons Restaurant floor of the hotel has also been redone. While everything physically remains in the same location in the room, the tired wood framework of the several commode rooms has been replaced with a fresh light tan woodwork. The same is true of the counter that houses the several wash basins, which is now held up by a series of similarly colored wooden legs. There has been no change in the urinals.
<br><br>
While WW has not viewed the women’s room, we assume that it too has been redone.
