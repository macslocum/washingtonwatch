This piece about the Tenleytown Ace Hardware does not signal that WW is now going to regularly review hardware stores.	However, this hardware store has become a regular stop when I am in the market for a variety of items.	Although, whenever I am unable to find the particular item for which I went to the store, it is inevitable that I will buy something that I really don’t need, but can find useful.
<br><br>
The store does not have the wide aisles of modern retail establishments. Every inch of shelf space is stuffed with something.
<br><br>
The thing that makes this store the most attractive is the people who work there.	They are everywhere and they all seem to know everything.	Ask any one of them a question about where something might be found, and they have an answer. The range is extraordinary.
<br><br>
On a recent visit I saw something that I have never seen before in any store. At the entrance stood one of the store employees, asking folks what they were looking for and directing them.	Then as they moved away from him he would use an internal store communication device to quietly call ahead to one of his colleagues, describing the person by size or clothing, etc., and suggesting where the person was heading.	That is special.

This was my 3rd visit to Ris.	On earlier visits I had found it a little more crowded and hectic than I ordinarily enjoy.	However, on this evening the crowd was reasonably sized and generally calmer than I had previously experienced. 	Our party included Rita, Bob, and Debbie.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, directly ahead is the greeting stand where you check in for your reservation.	Directly to the right there is a series of 4-person tables, and also to the right is an L-shaped bar with 14 high backed seats.	Also in the bar area are 3 high, two-person tables with accompanying high stools.	Food is also served at the bar, and there were a number of people taking advantage of that option.
<br><br>
Just past the bar there is an area of 3 booths, two 4s and one deuce.
<br><br>
The main dining room also begins at the front desk.	First there is a banquet with several 2s and 4s.	The balance of the large dining room is populated with 2 and 4-person tables that can be combined for larger parties.
<br><br>
Part of what made the evening so pleasant was our server, Florence, who hailed from the South of France.	She had a great disposition and did everything right for our group.	We have a habit of wanting to modify the menu offerings.
<br><br>
Rita started with Greens and herbs with Champagne Dijon vinaigrette and shaved parmesan.	For a main course she selected Monk fish Ossobuco, on Champagne lobster risotto, buttered cabbage, mushrooms, tomato fondue and truffle oil.
<br><br>
Debbie opted for Scallops margarita, lime marinated scallops with chiles, orange, avocado and tequila ice served in a margarita glass with a salted edge.	Her second course was Pan Roasted Chesapeake Rockfish with potato confit, pickled onions, olives, cured lemon, parmesan cream and minted pine nuts.
<br><br>
Bob’s first course was French Onion Soup Grantinee, followed by Chicken Pot Pie, with roasted chicken sherry sauce and a side salad.
<br><br>
I had the same soup to start.	Then I opted for the Pan Roasted Chicken with spinach, glazed carrots and tarragon sauce.	I eschewed the mashed potatoes and asked for a side order of Braised Red Cabbage.
<br><br>
The men’s room is relatively small.	As you enter there is a full length mirror to the right with a wide black wood frame.	Straight ahead is a reddish/ brownish black stone counter with inserted wash basin.	The mirror over the wash basin is also framed in wide black wood.	Towels are paper.
<br><br>
Behind the wash basin wall sits the commode.	This is a one person restroom. On the wall on which the commode resides is a full wall of 3 inch square tiles of multiple colors.	All other walls are brown painted.	The floor is covered with large black tiles.
<br><br>
One welcome change since my previous visit to the restaurant is that valet parking at the front door has been added.

I was in Closter and had a little time to kill before an event that was to begin at 9 a.m.	We drove around, looking for a place to stop for coffee and tea, and happened upon Gateaux, a Korean bakery and café.
<br><br>
The inside of the café is a huge vaulted room that has within it what would otherwise be described as an “outdoor” café.
<br><br>
On the left as you enter is a long counter with multiple open shelves that had more different kinds of rolls and buns than I have ever seen.	At least two-thirds of the offerings were items, plain and sweet, that I have not seen in any other bakery. There are also a variety of fresh loaves of bread on these shelves.
<br><br>
On the right is a second counter devoted to various kinds of cakes and pastries.
The working bakery is in another room, behind the counter on the left.
<br><br>
I had an excellent glass of freshly-made ice tea and a soft roll lightly decorated with lines of chocolate.	The person with whom I was traveling had a flat roll that had a raised, open center of a tuna fish mixture.
<br><br>
The men’s room had a single commode and wash basin, and a plain brown décor.	It was very clean.
<br><br>
If you are ever in the area, it is worth going a little out of your way to try the Gateaux’s offerings.

                                 At this time in 2009 there were 58 Democrats in the Senate (including 2 Independents) and 1 vacancy.	By July 2009, the Democrat caucus had 60 Senators, including the Independents.	Theoretically, the caucus had the capacity to end any filibuster.
<br><br>
At the outset of 2009, there were 256 Democrats in the House and 1 vacancy; by the 4th quarter of the year their majority stood at 258.
<br><br>
And then came the 2010 election.	Obama said the Democrats had taken a shellacking, and that is not a bad description.
<br><br>
The Republicans took over the House with a 242 seat majority, having picked up 63 Democratic seats.	Democrats lost 6 seats, but retained control of the Senate, with a 53-person majority.	However, the Democrats’ ability to deal with filibusters was gone, except if a sufficient number of Republicans bolted from their leadership. That will be a rare, if ever, happening.
<br><br>
Congressional job approval is little changed since January 2009.

71% of respondents believe that it is at least somewhat important for GOP
leaders to consider the policy positions of the Tea Party movement.	This includes
88% of Republicans, 72% of Independents and 53% of Democrats.	[Gallup 1/11]

The Democratic Party is seen in a more favorable light than the Republican Party.	It remains to be seen what the future will hold for either Party, given the unavoidable the clash between the incoming class of House and Senate members and the White House.
<br><br>
46% rate the Democratic Party favorably, as opposed to 45% who have the opposite view.	40% see the Republican Party favorably, while 49% see it unfavorably.	[NTY/CBS 1/11]

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

Going into the 2012 election cycle the Democrats have already lost one seat. The retirement of Democratic Senator Kent Conrad almost certainly means that a Republican, probably the sitting Governor, will win that State.	Effectively, the Democrats go into the election with a 52-person caucus.
<br>
<br>
Of the 7 Senate races that WW has in the Toss Up category, 6 are Democrats. While a number of these races have not yet developed, and a lot can happen in 20 months, the safe bet today would be that the Republicans will take control of that body.
<br>
<br>
Senator Jeff Bingaman will not be a candidate for re-election.	Having served 5 terms in the Senate, he has apparently decided it is enough.	It is too early to suggest how the race to succeed him will progress, but for the moment, New Mexico moves from Safe Democrat to Toss Up.
<br>
<br>
[Note: To be completely transparent about the fallibility of WW predictions, the following is a quote from the Washington Watch of June 2009:	“<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2009/06/2010_congressional_campaigs.shtml">At the moment, it appears that Democrats are likely to pick up Senate seats in 2010.	But it is not a sure thing.</a>”	Someone might describe that as an understatement. ]

Of the 63 Democrats who lost their seats in the 2010 election, 35% were in their first terms, 60% were in their 1st or 2nd terms.	3 of those who lost seats were in the 17th, 18th and 19th terms respectively.	Here is the whole list:
<br><br>
1st term – 22 members; 2nd term – 16 members; 3rd term – 3 members; 4th term – 3 members; 6th term – 3 members; 7th term – 4 members; 9th term – 2 members; 10th term – 1 member; 11th term – 2 members; 13th term – 2 members; 14th term – 2 members; 17th term – 1 member; 18th term – 1 member; 19th term – 1 member.

12 electoral votes will move as a result of the 2010 census.
<br><br>
10 States will lose 1 or more seats.	Each of the States is politically Democratic based on Gallop’s political identification measures.	(Ohio and New York each lose 2 seats; Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania each lose 1 seat.)
<br><br>
8 States will gain seats.	The 5 that are politically Republican will pick up 8 seats (Texas (4), Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, and Utah).	The 3 politically Democratic States pick up the other 4 seats (Florida (2), Nevada, and Washington).
<br><br>
On the numbers, these changes represent a net gain of 8 electoral votes for the Republicans.

The 2012 Presidential campaign is not just around the corner, but it is impossible to avoid the early machinations about who will be the Republican nominee.	The list is too long, and evidence of who might be leading this pack of a dozen or more potential candidates is too sparse, to say much more.

<br>
President Obama will not be challenged for his party’s nomination.

<br>
Early polls mean little, but CNN/OR, in January, surveyed registered voters on their current intention to vote for the President’s re-election.

Republicans will gather for their convention in Tampa Bay, Florida, beginning on August 27, 2012.	The Democrats will meet in Charlotte, North Carolina, starting on September 3, 2012.
<br>
<br>
If you have ever wondered whether selecting a particular city for a Party’s convention has 
any real impact on the outcome of the election, here is a partial answer.
<br>
<br>
Going back to 1936, Democrats have won the State in which their convention was sited 21 times.	The Republicans have won the State in which their convention was sited 17 times.	The next question is whether any of the victories or losses affected the ultimate result of the election. That question will likely be answered in a future edition of the Watch.

The closer folks are physically to the center of government, the more favorably they view it.
<br>
<br>
Over the last 9 years the change in attitudes toward the Federal government is quite dramatic.	In 2002, 64% rated the Federal government favorably and a year later it was even higher.	Now it is at 38%.	Equally dramatic is the number who describe the government unfavorably.	It has grown from 27% to 57%.
<br>
<br>
Attitudes toward State government have also dropped, but not nearly so dramatically, from 62% favorable to 53% favorable.	And toward local government the change is even more modest, dropping from 67% favorability to 63%.

There has been a shift of attitudes as to whether there should be more or less Federal regulation of business.	In February 2009 the public thought there was too little regulation as opposed to too much regulation, by 40% to 28%.	Two years later, by 45% to 27%, they think there is too much regulation.

When given a choice of a variety of economic issues (unemployment, budget deficit, health care, gas prices, Federal taxes, pension security, housing prices, changes in the stock market) and asked to select the one that is most significant, no issue comes close to “unemployment,” which is listed by 49% of the respondents.
<br>
<br>
The last time more than 40% of Americans selected unemployment as the
most important economic issue was 2003. crossed in 1993.	Here is the current list.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Unemployment	49% 
<li> Federal budget deficit	17% 
<li> Cost of health care	11% 
<li> Gas & energy prices	9%
</ul>

No other issue on the list was named by more than 3% of the respondents.

Further emphasizing the importance of unemployment as the key domestic issue, Gallup reports that 35% of Americans list unemployment as the most important problem facing the country.	This is the highest number seen by Gallup since 1983 (41%) .	[Gallup 2/11]
<br><br>
When it comes to the unemployment rate, you can choose your measurement of choice, depending on whether you are an optimist or a pessimist.
<br><br>
If you are an optimist your measurement of choice would be that of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which reported that unemployment had fallen from 9.4% in December 2010 to 9.0% in January 2011.	If, on the other hand, you are a pessimist, your measurement of choice would be the Gallup survey, which reported that unemployment had increased from 9.6% in December 2010 to 9.8% in January 2011.
<br><br>
Over the last 12 months the highest rate of unemployment reported by BLS was 10.6% in January 2010.	The highest rate of unemployment reported by Gallup over the same period was 10.9% in February 2010.
<br><br>
Looking a little more realistically at the unemployment situation, if you are an optimist, the BLS reports that 16.1% of Americans were either unemployed or underemployed in January 2011.	That is down from 18% in January 2010.	Gallup reports that 18.9% were unemployed or underemployed in January 2011.	The high point from Gallup over the previous 12 months was 20.4% in April 2010.
<br><br>
The total number of new manufacturing jobs created in January 2011 was 49,000, but the total number of new jobs created was only 36,000.	[BLS]

According to most of the members of the incoming 1st year class in the House of Representatives, their mandate is to cut Federal spending.	Not just a little, but a lot.	This is also the mantra of the Tea Party.

Go figure.

Sometime this Spring, there will be a need to raise the debt limit.	There is much conversation going on about who will or will not vote for it.	Then there is an ongoing debate as to when the critical moment will come, i.e., when in fact will the government default?	There are a variety of devices that the government has used in the past to postpone that inevitable moment.	There does seem to be agreement that the length of the delay made possible by these devices is substantially less than it was in the past.
<br><br>
If you listen to the horror stories about what might occur if the debt limit is not raised, it makes “locusts, pestilence, frogs, and the slaying of the first born” look like child’s play.
<br><br>
There does not seem to be any particular roadmap on how this plays out, but it is not about closing the National Parks for a few days.	The things that might happen include tax refunds not going out, government salaries not being paid in a timely fashion, interest payments on government debt may be postponed, contract payments owed to large and small companies could be suspended. Ultimately, if the stalemate continues for a sufficiently long time, it could affect the government’s ability to send out Social Security checks.
<br><br>
Of somewhat less direct consequence, the country’s cost of borrowing would likely increase meaningfully for a long period of time.	This could well lead to higher borrowing costs for everything from home mortgages to student and auto loans, to loans to small businesses, and credit card debt.

Note:	For some period of time I have had concerns about the practice of comparing data over long periods of time. For example, is it reasonable to compare the job approval rating of President Carter with that of President Obama, given the changes in the amount and kind of public communication and information that is broadly available?	As with most such questions, I asked Peter Hart for his views. He has no problem with this type of comparison.	He said in part, “it is like baseball and tennis sport records, the equipment changes, but the records remain.”	And, “Overall, the world may change, but the records and the marks are still good benchmarks.”
