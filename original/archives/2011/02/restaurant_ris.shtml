This was my 3rd visit to Ris.	On earlier visits I had found it a little more crowded and hectic than I ordinarily enjoy.	However, on this evening the crowd was reasonably sized and generally calmer than I had previously experienced. 	Our party included Rita, Bob, and Debbie.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, directly ahead is the greeting stand where you check in for your reservation.	Directly to the right there is a series of 4-person tables, and also to the right is an L-shaped bar with 14 high backed seats.	Also in the bar area are 3 high, two-person tables with accompanying high stools.	Food is also served at the bar, and there were a number of people taking advantage of that option.
<br><br>
Just past the bar there is an area of 3 booths, two 4s and one deuce.
<br><br>
The main dining room also begins at the front desk.	First there is a banquet with several 2s and 4s.	The balance of the large dining room is populated with 2 and 4-person tables that can be combined for larger parties.
<br><br>
Part of what made the evening so pleasant was our server, Florence, who hailed from the South of France.	She had a great disposition and did everything right for our group.	We have a habit of wanting to modify the menu offerings.
<br><br>
Rita started with Greens and herbs with Champagne Dijon vinaigrette and shaved parmesan.	For a main course she selected Monk fish Ossobuco, on Champagne lobster risotto, buttered cabbage, mushrooms, tomato fondue and truffle oil.
<br><br>
Debbie opted for Scallops margarita, lime marinated scallops with chiles, orange, avocado and tequila ice served in a margarita glass with a salted edge.	Her second course was Pan Roasted Chesapeake Rockfish with potato confit, pickled onions, olives, cured lemon, parmesan cream and minted pine nuts.
<br><br>
Bob’s first course was French Onion Soup Grantinee, followed by Chicken Pot Pie, with roasted chicken sherry sauce and a side salad.
<br><br>
I had the same soup to start.	Then I opted for the Pan Roasted Chicken with spinach, glazed carrots and tarragon sauce.	I eschewed the mashed potatoes and asked for a side order of Braised Red Cabbage.
<br><br>
The men’s room is relatively small.	As you enter there is a full length mirror to the right with a wide black wood frame.	Straight ahead is a reddish/ brownish black stone counter with inserted wash basin.	The mirror over the wash basin is also framed in wide black wood.	Towels are paper.
<br><br>
Behind the wash basin wall sits the commode.	This is a one person restroom. On the wall on which the commode resides is a full wall of 3 inch square tiles of multiple colors.	All other walls are brown painted.	The floor is covered with large black tiles.
<br><br>
One welcome change since my previous visit to the restaurant is that valet parking at the front door has been added.
