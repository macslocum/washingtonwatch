I was in Closter and had a little time to kill before an event that was to begin at 9 a.m.	We drove around, looking for a place to stop for coffee and tea, and happened upon Gateaux, a Korean bakery and café.
<br><br>
The inside of the café is a huge vaulted room that has within it what would otherwise be described as an “outdoor” café.
<br><br>
On the left as you enter is a long counter with multiple open shelves that had more different kinds of rolls and buns than I have ever seen.	At least two-thirds of the offerings were items, plain and sweet, that I have not seen in any other bakery. There are also a variety of fresh loaves of bread on these shelves.
<br><br>
On the right is a second counter devoted to various kinds of cakes and pastries.
The working bakery is in another room, behind the counter on the left.
<br><br>
I had an excellent glass of freshly-made ice tea and a soft roll lightly decorated with lines of chocolate.	The person with whom I was traveling had a flat roll that had a raised, open center of a tuna fish mixture.
<br><br>
The men’s room had a single commode and wash basin, and a plain brown décor.	It was very clean.
<br><br>
If you are ever in the area, it is worth going a little out of your way to try the Gateaux’s offerings.
