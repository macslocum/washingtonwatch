<h1>Lincoln Restaurant</h1>
Lincoln Center<br>
142 West 65th Street<br>
NY, NY 10023<br>
Reservations 212-359-6500<br>
<a href="http://www.lincolnrestaurante.com">www.lincolnrestaurante.com</a></div>This restaurant is located on the Lincoln Center Plaza.	The floor-to-high-ceiling, glass, window walls provide a terrific view of the theaters surrounding the plaza and the reflecting pool.
<br><br>
Everything about the restaurant is metal, hard woods and straight lines. However, the seats are much more comfortable than are sometimes found in the “modern” format restaurants.
<br><br>
Debbie and I went to Lincoln with Robie and Bill for lunch before attending a performance of “Warhorse.”	(While WW does not do theater reviews this show is well worth making an effort to attend.)
<br><br>
As her appetizer Robie requested plain asparagus that were offered as part of another dish, followed by Insalata Di Pollo Alla Griglia – chicken breast, arugula, orange, red onion and Parmigiano-Reggiano.
<br><br>
Debbie started with Linguine Alle Vongole – Littleneck and Razor Clams, Pancetta.	For her second course she selected Frittata Di Asparagai E Spugnole, green asparagus, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano.
<br><br>
Bill and I had exactly the same meal.	Acciuga E Radicchio -- anchovy, bibb lettuce, radish, cucumber, salsa tonnata -- followed by Pollo Alla Marsala -- braised chicken legs, crimini mushroom, red bliss potatoes.
<br><br>
Chicken is generally a favorite dish of mine, and this chicken dish was as good, if not better than, any I have ever enjoyed.
<br><br>
Requested modifications of dishes were treated by the server as routine, and when the relevant dish arrived the requested modification had been made.
<br><br>
The service was excellent.	As soon as we were seated we were asked about the time frame of our visit, <em>i.e.</em>, were we going to a show?	And from then on we could not have enjoyed better service.
<br><br>
The restaurant seats about 140 people at tables that seat 2 to 6 people.	These tables can easily be modified to build large tables.	Of particular interest is the open kitchen and bread preparation area.	Both are behind a floor-to-ceiling glass wall.
<br><br>
The restrooms are in the basement.	The obvious course to reach them is a set of stairs to which I was directed by the serving personnel.	However, there is an elevator.
<br><br>
There are six unisex restrooms, in two lines of three, facing each other.	One downside to this particular arrangement is that there is no apparent way to know which of the restrooms is in use except to try each of the doors.	Each of the restrooms has a commode and washbasin.	The interior color is light gray, with a square wall cutout in which are stacked cloth towels.	The floor is covered with large tiles.
<br><br>
The restaurant is open seven days a week for lunch, pre-theater, and dinner. There is also a weekend brunch.
<br><br>
Generally reservations are suggested, but there is a bar that offers the full
menu.

<h1>Gabriel’s Bar and Restaurant</h1>
11 West 60th Street<br>
NY, NY 10023<br>

Fax 212-956-2309<br>
<a href="http://www.gabrielsbarandrest.com">www.gabrielsbarandrest.com</a></div>I have eaten at Gabriel’s more often by far than any other restaurant in New York City.	It is my New York “commissary,” just like the several restaurants that fall into that category in Washington, DC.
<br><br>
I do not know why I have not written about it before now.	It is everything I like about a restaurant.	It is physically comfortable; casual dress is totally acceptable and is, in fact, the norm; the food is varied, interesting, and well prepared; the service is excellent and friendly; and the dominant color in the men’s room is bright blue.
<br><br>
When you enter the restaurant there is a long L-shaped bar to the left, and the dining room tables begin within 10 feet of the entrance, where the greeter’s stand is located.
<br><br>
There is a large main dining room, as well as a large separate room at the back of the restaurant that can be used either for a private party or as part of the main dining room.	There are a number of booths and tables ranging in size from twos to rounds of six or eight.
<br><br>
Debbie had as an appetizer a chopped tomato, cucumber and crab salad, followed by sautéed flounder.
<br><br>
I started with a Caesar salad, and then had the baby chicken, which is marinated in garlic, lemon, and rosemary, and then served with garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini.	Just in case there were not enough carbs in the meal already, we shared a plate of spaghetti in tomato sauce.	Dessert was, as usual, ice cream.
<br><br>
On this evening I did not have the dish which I have ordered there more than any other, the Kid Arrabbiato.	It is slow roasted goat, marinated with red wine vinegar and hot pepper, and served with roast potatoes and snow peas.	Another of my favorite dishes is a salad of beets and red leaf lettuce, with Dijon mustard dressing, served with roasted almonds and goat cheese.
<br><br>
As noted earlier, the dominant feature in the restroom is the bright blue walls.	Immediately behind the entry door is an old-style floor-based urinal of white ceramic.	There is a short divider, and then a white ceramic washbasin with a mirror.	On the opposite side of the restroom are two commode stalls with partial walls enclosing them.	Of course the dividing walls are bright blue.
<br><br>
The restaurant is open Monday-Friday for lunch and dinner, and for dinner only on Saturday.	Try it, you will like it.

<br><br>
42% have little or no confidence in the Congress.	10% do express confidence, but it is likely the lowest confidence level on record going back to 1975. [NBC/WSJ 6/11]

<h2>The Senate</h2>

Depending on who you talk to, either Republicans are going to take six Senate seats currently held by Democrats/Independents, giving the Republicans a 53/47 margin, or the Democrats will hold the Senate with a tie, in which the Vice President, presuming Obama’s re-election, will cast the deciding vote.
<br><br>
Looking at seats not up in 2012, and seats that are up but are safe or leaning to one Party or the other, Democrats end up with 45seats and the Republicans with 46 seats.	Of the Toss-up seats, Obama won 5 of them in 2008 and McCain won 4.

<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 51</li>

Here is how the 33 Senate elections -- 23 Democratic incumbents (includes 2 Independents), 10 Republican incumbents -- look to me at this time.	(D=Dem incumbent in office, R=GOP incumbent in office, I=Ind. Incumbent in office) Underlining reflects retirement.<br><br>

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>

The generic Congressional ballot is dead even: Democrats 44%/Republicans 44%. [NBC/WSJ 6/11]
<br><br>
53% of registered voters are inclined to look around for someone other than their current Congressperson for whom to vote.	37% are satisfied with the incumbent.	[WP/ABC 6/11]
<br><br>
Early reports suggested that the Democrats would lose seats as a result of re-districting.	Now it appears that the Democrats will not lose seats, and in fact may pick up a few.
<br><br>
WW has regularly reprinted the “House Dashboard” published by the Cook Political Report.	The data below, through May 16, 2011, is from the Dashboard. However, the Dashboard is not being published at this time because of the uncertainties caused by re-districting.	Therefore the chart below reflects the Cook’s current Competitive House Race Chart through June 21, 2011.

                                 <h2>The Primaries</h2>

In a May 31st column, Mark Mellman makes the case that the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, seen together, have a dramatic impact on the selection of Presidential nominees.	He notes that, “Since 1976...every single nominee but one in both parties, won either Iowa or New Hampshire.”
<br><br>
Conceding their impact on the process, the question that remains is whether they <em>should</em> have the impact they seem to have.	The bottom line is that neither of these States are close to resembling the country as a whole.

WW looked at just a few characteristics. Here is the result:

<h2>The Republican Nomination - And then there were 15</h2>


The Republican nomination field is not yet complete. have indicated an interest in thinking about or securing the Republican nomination. 8 people have announced that they are running and have taken the requisite steps to launch their campaigns.	7 putative candidates have not made a final decision to run or to punt.	Finally, 4 potential candidates have already announced that they are not going to engage in this race.

The chart below notes the status of each of these people.

<h2>Republican Nomination Score Card</h2>

Given the ever increasing number of people who are being talked about as potential candidates for the Republican nomination for President, WW has decided to publish the following score card until the final field is established.	[“Exploring” means that the person has established a Presidential Exploratory Committee or a political action committee designed to fund early efforts.]	[ “Running” means that the person has filed a regular Presidential Committee with the FEC or has made an unequivocal announcement of intention.]

Of registered voters who say they will vote in the Republican primaries, 45% are satisfied with the current choices and 45% are dissatisfied.	[NBC/WSJ 6/11]

In what is a modest shift from 2008, Republicans prefer a Presidential candidate who has the best chance to beat President Obama, as opposed to one who agrees with them on almost all of the issues.
<br><br>
50% prefer the “best chance to win” candidate, while 44% are more concerned that the person agree with them on most issues.	Leading up to the 2008 Presidential election, a slight majority of Republicans opted for the candidate with whom they agreed on the issues, and about 40% went for the person who could win.
<br><br>
Of interest is the fact that more conservative Republicans (52%), rather than Liberal/moderate Republicans (43%), speak out for the candidate who has the best chance to win. [Gallup 6/11]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
The Tea Party Movement will have an impact on the Republican primary and the general election.	How its energy is directed will affect both of those elections.
<br><br>
28% of Americans are at least somewhat positive about the Tea Party Movement.	43% are at least somewhat negative.	There are twice as many people who are “very negative” ( 27%) than are “very positive” (13%).	The high point for the Tea Partiers was in June 2010, when 34% were at least somewhat positive and 31% somewhat negative.	[NBC 6/11]
<br><br>
If the energy of this movement results in the selection of a Republican nominee who primarily represents the most conservative element of the party, then it will have aided Obama’s re-election effort.

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The following are random thoughts about the various Republican candidates. (References to positive/negative feelings toward each candidate come from the 6/11 NBC/WSJ.)

<h2>Mitt Romney</h2>

He is clearly the front runner. He was expected to be the “winner” of the New Hampshire debate and he did that.	He will be able to raise significant sums, and he has personal resources on which he can fall back, if need be.	Questions for Romney include the health care initiative he passed in Massachusetts, and whether the more conservative elements of the Party will feel a need to bring him down.
<br><br>
He must also deal with public attitudes about the Mormon faith.	(Jon Huntsman faces the same issue.)	This attitude may well impact the Republican nomination process, and if one of these men is the Republican nominee, it could have an impact on the general election.
<br><br>
Some 22% of Americans (19% of Independents) say they would not vote for a Mormon.	This number is greater by some margin than the number of folks who say they would not vote for a person because he or she is Jewish, Baptist or Catholic. [Gallup 6/11]
<br><br>
[27% positive/26% negative/30%neutral/17%DK]

<h2>Sarah Palin</h2>

Palin has not announced whether she will make the race.	Her recent bus tour of the eastern United States, starting on Memorial Day and continuing for several days leading up to the New Hampshire debate, was pretty ham-handed.	But, of course, she claimed that this had nothing to do with a possible Presidential race.
<br><br>
Michelle Bachmann’s entry into the race makes life more difficult for Palin. Bachmann appeals to the same folks, and her capacity to deal with issues undoubtedly exceeds Palin’s by some margin.
<br><br>
When asked whether they would consider voting for Sarah Palin for President in 2012, 64% said they would definitely not vote for her.	7% definitely would vote for her, and 28% will consider it.	[WP/ABC 6/11]
<br><br>
[24% positive/54% negative/19% neutral/3%DK]

<h2>Herman Cain</h2>

The most interesting thing about Herman Cain’s candidacy is his ranking in this survey.	He has no previous electoral experience, and yet he is running 3rd at 12%.	More than anything it is a statement about the relative satisfaction with the other better known candidates.

<h2>Rick Perry</h2>

The Governor of Texas has not yet announced whether or not he will run, but he is drawing a fair amount of attention.	It is assumed that fundraising would not be a problem for him.	There are many things about his tenure as Governor that will work for or against him should he join the fray.	He brings to the contest great strength among the conservative elements of the Party who are currently drawn to other candidates already committed to the race.	He is not well known which gives him lots of room to grow.
<br><br>
[12% positive/ 15% negative/18% neutral/44DK]

<h2>Ron Paul</h2>

Paul has a distinct point of view about the Federal government – he would do away with much of the Executive branch, but his commentary is not easily understood.	As he has in the past, he will be an” also ran” once again.

<h2>Newt Gingrich</h2>

While he may continue to amble around the country at a relatively leisurely pace, his campaign never got off the ground and is essentially over.	The loss of many of the principals of his operating and fundraising staff simply will not be overcome.
<br><br>
Even before the latest blowup, Gingrich’s positive intensity score, as measured by Gallup, had dropped precipitously among Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents.	From a recent high of 19 in March/April, he had fallen to 6 in the last half of May.
<br><br>
What WW found unfortunate was the effort by a number of the departing staff to lay blame for Newt’s problems at the feet of his wife, Callista Gingrich.	The role of the spouses of various candidates varies dramatically.	At the end of the day, it is the candidate who is responsible for his or her actions or non-actions.	If these staff wanted to blame someone, rather than just quietly walk out the door, they should have blamed Newt alone.

[16% positive/48% negative/23%neutral/13%DK]

<h2>Tim Pawlenty</h2>

Pawlenty’s star, which had started to rise, slipped down below the horizon as a result of his less than stellar New Hampshire debate performance.	Having gigged Romney hard the day before on “Obamney Care,” Pawlenty ducked when given the opportunity to reprise his comments during the debate.
<br><br>
Pawlenty had been touted as everyone’s second choice, but that is no longer the case.
<br><br>
At least at this time, the people who know Pawlenty best, the people of Minnesota, are supporting Obama over Pawlenty by 5 points.	[Survey USA 5/11]	
<br><br>
[14% positive/15% negative/25%neutral/46%DK]

<h2>Rick Santorum</h2>

Santorum is competing to be the most conservative in the Republican firmament.	His opposition to abortion (no exception for rape or incest) includes the belief that any doctor who performs an abortion should be subject to criminal charges.
<br><br>
Santorum will not be a contender for the nomination.

<h2>Michelle Bachmann</h2>

Bachmann was the surprise of the New Hampshire debate.	While none of the existing candidates or potential entries has positions that are more conservative than hers, Bachmann’s performance was particularly strong.
<br><br>
During the last couple of years, colleagues in the House of Representatives have come to regard her as an effective and prepared Member.
<br><br>
She is an Iowa native, which gives her a leg up on that State.	However, like Pawlenty, those who theoretically know her best do not support her as a general election candidate.	Most recently, she trailed Obama in Minnesota by 25 points. [USA Survey 6/11]
<br><br>
One clear advantage that Bachmann has is in the fundraising department.	In the 2005-06 election for her Minnesota House seat, she raised $2.6 million.	Then in 2007-08 she took in $3.5 million.	Then came 2009-10, when she decided to break the bank.	Total receipts were $13.6 million.	Through the first quarter of this cycle she had raised $1.75 million.

<h2>Jon Huntsman</h2>

Huntsman is the wildest of wild cards.	He was a very successful two-term governor of Utah.	Most recently, he was selected by Obama as the U.S. Ambassador to China.	Many Republicans are not wild about the idea of an Obama Administration official as their nominee.	And, on a number of issues, he is not as hard a conservative as many in the Party would like.	On the other hand, he is close to being the least known of the candidates.
<br><br>
Time will tell on this one.
<br><br>
[7% positive/9% negative/20% neutral/64% DK]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

There will not be a significant contest related to the re-nomination of Obama. In five separate surveys to date in 2011, CNN/OPR has asked whether Obama should be re-nominated. The range of support for his re-nomination was 76% to 83%.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<h2>General Election</h2>

24% of potential voters say they will definitely vote to re-elect President Obama, and an additional 29% say they will consider voting for him.	45% say they will definitely not vote for him.	[WP/ABC 6/11]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Two early June surveys reach different results when President Obama is matched against a Republican general election candidate.
<br><br>
The NBC/WSJ survey found that 45% of respondents said they would probably vote for Obama, and 40% said they would vote for the Republican candidate.
<br><br>
The Gallup survey taken on the same dates found 39% more likely to vote for Obama, and 44% for likely to vote for the Republican candidate.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

With the caveat that all of the following is meaningless this far before the general election, here are the numbers by which Obama leads various Republican candidates.

For the first time in memory, an incumbent President has not set up his re-election campaign headquarters in DC, Virginia or Maryland.	The Obama campaign has returned to its roots in Chicago.
<br><br>
Many political and media types (including yours truly) have treated this decision as a big mistake.	On reflection it may be a pretty good idea.	It has the effect of allowing the campaign staff to focus on its particular job, without having to be encumbered by the atmosphere and clamor that are so much a part of Washington.
<br><br>
After all, given modern communication, it is just as easy for David Axelrod, Jim Messina, Juliana Smoot, and David Plouffe to have a conversation from the White House to Chicago, as it is to have a conversation from Arlington or downtown D.C to the White House.	And, if they forget what each other looks like, they can always use video conferencing, Skype or Facebook.

While Obama has gotten great credit for his handling of foreign policy with the death of bin Laden, the public’s assessment of his handling of foreign policy has consistently been more positive than negative during his time in office.	Currently, his job approval on foreign policy is 50%, compared to a disapproval of 44%.	At no time has disapproval exceeded approval.	The spreads between approval and disapproval have been as small as 3 points (4/11) and as high as 25 points (4/09).
<br><br>
The same cannot be said of the public’s assessment of how he has handled the economy.	Currently, 54% disapprove of how he is handling the economy, while 41% approve.	Disapproval has exceeded approval consistently since December 2009, with one exception.	The exception was in May 2010, when approval exceeded disapproval by 2 points.	[NBC/WSJ 6/11]

                                 Recently, someone asked me when “Washington Political Watch” started. This 100th issue seemed the right time to answer that question.
<br><br>
The first issue of WW in its current format was published on January 19,
1987.
<br><br>
But it all started while I was at the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart (now K&LGates).	On June 14, 1985,	I began writing a series of memoranda, on firm letterhead, commenting on the progress of what became the Tax Reform Act of 1986.	On August 21, 1985 , I started writing another memorandum that dealt with electoral politics.	These memos circulated within the firm and to a few clients.	In mid-1987, one of my partners suggested that I formalize these memos.	 I took his advice and so was born, on June 19, 1987, “Kirkpatrick & Lockhart’s Washington Political Watch.”
<br><br>
The first 15 editions came out under that title.
<br><br>
When I joined the Duberstein Group, I re-titled the “Watch” to “Mike Berman’s Washington Political Watch,” beginning with the 16th edition.
<br><br>
One other change to be noted is that for the first 72 editions of WW it took roughly ten days from the time the issue was completed until the time it was in your hands.	That was the time required to send it to the printer, get a proof back to be checked, and then print and mail it.	Beginning with edition 73, on <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/downloads/Watch07.Feb.pdf">February 6, 2007</a>, the WW has been delivered by email.	Thus, it is in your hands within a day or so of the time it is finished.
