<h2>The Primaries</h2>

In a May 31st column, Mark Mellman makes the case that the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, seen together, have a dramatic impact on the selection of Presidential nominees.	He notes that, “Since 1976...every single nominee but one in both parties, won either Iowa or New Hampshire.”
<br><br>
Conceding their impact on the process, the question that remains is whether they <em>should</em> have the impact they seem to have.	The bottom line is that neither of these States are close to resembling the country as a whole.
<br><br>
WW looked at just a few characteristics. Here is the result:

<h2>The Republican Nomination - And then there were 15</h2>


The Republican nomination field is not yet complete. have indicated an interest in thinking about or securing the Republican nomination. 8 people have announced that they are running and have taken the requisite steps to launch their campaigns.	7 putative candidates have not made a final decision to run or to punt.	Finally, 4 potential candidates have already announced that they are not going to engage in this race.
<br><br>
The chart below notes the status of each of these people.

<h2>Republican Nomination Score Card</h2>

Given the ever increasing number of people who are being talked about as potential candidates for the Republican nomination for President, WW has decided to publish the following score card until the final field is established.	[“Exploring” means that the person has established a Presidential Exploratory Committee or a political action committee designed to fund early efforts.]	[ “Running” means that the person has filed a regular Presidential Committee with the FEC or has made an unequivocal announcement of intention.]

Of registered voters who say they will vote in the Republican primaries, 45% are satisfied with the current choices and 45% are dissatisfied.	[NBC/WSJ 6/11]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

In what is a modest shift from 2008, Republicans prefer a Presidential candidate who has the best chance to beat President Obama, as opposed to one who agrees with them on almost all of the issues.
<br><br>
50% prefer the “best chance to win” candidate, while 44% are more concerned that the person agree with them on most issues.	Leading up to the 2008 Presidential election, a slight majority of Republicans opted for the candidate with whom they agreed on the issues, and about 40% went for the person who could win.
<br><br>
Of interest is the fact that more conservative Republicans (52%), rather than Liberal/moderate Republicans (43%), speak out for the candidate who has the best chance to win. [Gallup 6/11]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
The Tea Party Movement will have an impact on the Republican primary and the general election.	How its energy is directed will affect both of those elections.
<br><br>
28% of Americans are at least somewhat positive about the Tea Party Movement.	43% are at least somewhat negative.	There are twice as many people who are “very negative” ( 27%) than are “very positive” (13%).	The high point for the Tea Partiers was in June 2010, when 34% were at least somewhat positive and 31% somewhat negative.	[NBC 6/11]
<br><br>
If the energy of this movement results in the selection of a Republican nominee who primarily represents the most conservative element of the party, then it will have aided Obama’s re-election effort.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The following are random thoughts about the various Republican candidates. (References to positive/negative feelings toward each candidate come from the 6/11 NBC/WSJ.)

<h2>Mitt Romney</h2>

He is clearly the front runner. He was expected to be the “winner” of the New Hampshire debate and he did that.	He will be able to raise significant sums, and he has personal resources on which he can fall back, if need be.	Questions for Romney include the health care initiative he passed in Massachusetts, and whether the more conservative elements of the Party will feel a need to bring him down.
<br><br>
He must also deal with public attitudes about the Mormon faith.	(Jon Huntsman faces the same issue.)	This attitude may well impact the Republican nomination process, and if one of these men is the Republican nominee, it could have an impact on the general election.
<br><br>
Some 22% of Americans (19% of Independents) say they would not vote for a Mormon.	This number is greater by some margin than the number of folks who say they would not vote for a person because he or she is Jewish, Baptist or Catholic. [Gallup 6/11]
<br><br>
[27% positive/26% negative/30%neutral/17%DK]

<h2>Sarah Palin</h2>

Palin has not announced whether she will make the race.	Her recent bus tour of the eastern United States, starting on Memorial Day and continuing for several days leading up to the New Hampshire debate, was pretty ham-handed.	But, of course, she claimed that this had nothing to do with a possible Presidential race.
<br><br>
Michelle Bachmann’s entry into the race makes life more difficult for Palin. Bachmann appeals to the same folks, and her capacity to deal with issues undoubtedly exceeds Palin’s by some margin.
<br><br>
When asked whether they would consider voting for Sarah Palin for President in 2012, 64% said they would definitely not vote for her.	7% definitely would vote for her, and 28% will consider it.	[WP/ABC 6/11]
<br><br>
[24% positive/54% negative/19% neutral/3%DK]

<h2>Herman Cain</h2>

The most interesting thing about Herman Cain’s candidacy is his ranking in this survey.	He has no previous electoral experience, and yet he is running 3rd at 12%.	More than anything it is a statement about the relative satisfaction with the other better known candidates.

<h2>Rick Perry</h2>

The Governor of Texas has not yet announced whether or not he will run, but he is drawing a fair amount of attention.	It is assumed that fundraising would not be a problem for him.	There are many things about his tenure as Governor that will work for or against him should he join the fray.	He brings to the contest great strength among the conservative elements of the Party who are currently drawn to other candidates already committed to the race.	He is not well known which gives him lots of room to grow.
<br><br>
[12% positive/ 15% negative/18% neutral/44DK]

<h2>Ron Paul</h2>

Paul has a distinct point of view about the Federal government – he would do away with much of the Executive branch, but his commentary is not easily understood.	As he has in the past, he will be an” also ran” once again.

<h2>Newt Gingrich</h2>

While he may continue to amble around the country at a relatively leisurely pace, his campaign never got off the ground and is essentially over.	The loss of many of the principals of his operating and fundraising staff simply will not be overcome.
<br><br>
Even before the latest blowup, Gingrich’s positive intensity score, as measured by Gallup, had dropped precipitously among Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents.	From a recent high of 19 in March/April, he had fallen to 6 in the last half of May.
<br><br>
What WW found unfortunate was the effort by a number of the departing staff to lay blame for Newt’s problems at the feet of his wife, Callista Gingrich.	The role of the spouses of various candidates varies dramatically.	At the end of the day, it is the candidate who is responsible for his or her actions or non-actions.	If these staff wanted to blame someone, rather than just quietly walk out the door, they should have blamed Newt alone.

[16% positive/48% negative/23%neutral/13%DK]

<h2>Tim Pawlenty</h2>

Pawlenty’s star, which had started to rise, slipped down below the horizon as a result of his less than stellar New Hampshire debate performance.	Having gigged Romney hard the day before on “Obamney Care,” Pawlenty ducked when given the opportunity to reprise his comments during the debate.
<br><br>
Pawlenty had been touted as everyone’s second choice, but that is no longer the case.
<br><br>
At least at this time, the people who know Pawlenty best, the people of Minnesota, are supporting Obama over Pawlenty by 5 points.	[Survey USA 5/11]	
<br><br>
[14% positive/15% negative/25%neutral/46%DK]

<h2>Rick Santorum</h2>

Santorum is competing to be the most conservative in the Republican firmament.	His opposition to abortion (no exception for rape or incest) includes the belief that any doctor who performs an abortion should be subject to criminal charges.
<br><br>
Santorum will not be a contender for the nomination.

<h2>Michelle Bachmann</h2>

Bachmann was the surprise of the New Hampshire debate.	While none of the existing candidates or potential entries has positions that are more conservative than hers, Bachmann’s performance was particularly strong.
<br><br>
During the last couple of years, colleagues in the House of Representatives have come to regard her as an effective and prepared Member.
<br><br>
She is an Iowa native, which gives her a leg up on that State.	However, like Pawlenty, those who theoretically know her best do not support her as a general election candidate.	Most recently, she trailed Obama in Minnesota by 25 points. [USA Survey 6/11]
<br><br>
One clear advantage that Bachmann has is in the fundraising department.	In the 2005-06 election for her Minnesota House seat, she raised $2.6 million.	Then in 2007-08 she took in $3.5 million.	Then came 2009-10, when she decided to break the bank.	Total receipts were $13.6 million.	Through the first quarter of this cycle she had raised $1.75 million.

<h2>Jon Huntsman</h2>

Huntsman is the wildest of wild cards.	He was a very successful two-term governor of Utah.	Most recently, he was selected by Obama as the U.S. Ambassador to China.	Many Republicans are not wild about the idea of an Obama Administration official as their nominee.	And, on a number of issues, he is not as hard a conservative as many in the Party would like.	On the other hand, he is close to being the least known of the candidates.
<br><br>
Time will tell on this one.
<br><br>
[7% positive/9% negative/20% neutral/64% DK]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

There will not be a significant contest related to the re-nomination of Obama. In five separate surveys to date in 2011, CNN/OPR has asked whether Obama should be re-nominated. The range of support for his re-nomination was 76% to 83%.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<h2>General Election</h2>

24% of potential voters say they will definitely vote to re-elect President Obama, and an additional 29% say they will consider voting for him.	45% say they will definitely not vote for him.	[WP/ABC 6/11]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Two early June surveys reach different results when President Obama is matched against a Republican general election candidate.
<br><br>
The NBC/WSJ survey found that 45% of respondents said they would probably vote for Obama, and 40% said they would vote for the Republican candidate.
<br><br>
The Gallup survey taken on the same dates found 39% more likely to vote for Obama, and 44% for likely to vote for the Republican candidate.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

With the caveat that all of the following is meaningless this far before the general election, here are the numbers by which Obama leads various Republican candidates.

For the first time in memory, an incumbent President has not set up his re-election campaign headquarters in DC, Virginia or Maryland.	The Obama campaign has returned to its roots in Chicago.
<br><br>
Many political and media types (including yours truly) have treated this decision as a big mistake.	On reflection it may be a pretty good idea.	It has the effect of allowing the campaign staff to focus on its particular job, without having to be encumbered by the atmosphere and clamor that are so much a part of Washington.
<br><br>
After all, given modern communication, it is just as easy for David Axelrod, Jim Messina, Juliana Smoot, and David Plouffe to have a conversation from the White House to Chicago, as it is to have a conversation from Arlington or downtown D.C to the White House.	And, if they forget what each other looks like, they can always use video conferencing, Skype or Facebook.
