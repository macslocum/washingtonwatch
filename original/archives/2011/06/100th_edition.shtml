<p></p>
Recently, someone asked me when “Washington Political Watch” started. This 100th issue seemed the right time to answer that question.
<br><br>
The first issue of WW in its current format was published on January 19,
1987.
<br><br>
But it all started while I was at the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart (now K&LGates).	On June 14, 1985,	I began writing a series of memoranda, on firm letterhead, commenting on the progress of what became the Tax Reform Act of 1986.	On August 21, 1985 , I started writing another memorandum that dealt with electoral politics.	These memos circulated within the firm and to a few clients.	In mid-1987, one of my partners suggested that I formalize these memos.	 I took his advice and so was born, on June 19, 1987, “Kirkpatrick & Lockhart’s Washington Political Watch.”
<br><br>
The first 15 editions came out under that title.
<br><br>
When I joined the Duberstein Group, I re-titled the “Watch” to “Mike Berman’s Washington Political Watch,” beginning with the 16th edition.
<br><br>
One other change to be noted is that for the first 72 editions of WW it took roughly ten days from the time the issue was completed until the time it was in your hands.	That was the time required to send it to the printer, get a proof back to be checked, and then print and mail it.	Beginning with edition 73, on <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/downloads/Watch07.Feb.pdf">February 6, 2007</a>, the WW has been delivered by email.	Thus, it is in your hands within a day or so of the time it is finished.
