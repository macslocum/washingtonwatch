<h1>Gabriel’s Bar and Restaurant</h1>

<a href="http://www.gabrielsbarandrest.com">www.gabrielsbarandrest.com</a></div>I have eaten at Gabriel’s more often by far than any other restaurant in New York City.	It is my New York “commissary,” just like the several restaurants that fall into that category in Washington, DC.
<br><br>
I do not know why I have not written about it before now.	It is everything I like about a restaurant.	It is physically comfortable; casual dress is totally acceptable and is, in fact, the norm; the food is varied, interesting, and well prepared; the service is excellent and friendly; and the dominant color in the men’s room is bright blue.
<br><br>
When you enter the restaurant there is a long L-shaped bar to the left, and the dining room tables begin within 10 feet of the entrance, where the greeter’s stand is located.
<br><br>
There is a large main dining room, as well as a large separate room at the back of the restaurant that can be used either for a private party or as part of the main dining room.	There are a number of booths and tables ranging in size from twos to rounds of six or eight.
<br><br>
Debbie had as an appetizer a chopped tomato, cucumber and crab salad, followed by sautéed flounder.
<br><br>
I started with a Caesar salad, and then had the baby chicken, which is marinated in garlic, lemon, and rosemary, and then served with garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini.	Just in case there were not enough carbs in the meal already, we shared a plate of spaghetti in tomato sauce.	Dessert was, as usual, ice cream.
<br><br>
On this evening I did not have the dish which I have ordered there more than any other, the Kid Arrabbiato.	It is slow roasted goat, marinated with red wine vinegar and hot pepper, and served with roast potatoes and snow peas.	Another of my favorite dishes is a salad of beets and red leaf lettuce, with Dijon mustard dressing, served with roasted almonds and goat cheese.
<br><br>
As noted earlier, the dominant feature in the restroom is the bright blue walls.	Immediately behind the entry door is an old-style floor-based urinal of white ceramic.	There is a short divider, and then a white ceramic washbasin with a mirror.	On the opposite side of the restroom are two commode stalls with partial walls enclosing them.	Of course the dividing walls are bright blue.
<br><br>
The restaurant is open Monday-Friday for lunch and dinner, and for dinner only on Saturday.	Try it, you will like it.
