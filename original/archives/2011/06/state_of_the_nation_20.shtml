62% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, while 29% say it is going in the right direction.	This is a 12-point increase from last month, when 50% thought the country was on the wrong track.
<br><br>
30% believe the economy will get worse during the next 12 months, up from 21% who had that view in April.	This is the most pessimistic the public has been in responding to this question since April 2009.	Additionally, 35% say their personal economic situation has gotten worse during the past 12 months.

The official Labor Department unemployment rate for the month of May was 9.2%.	That number does not include those who are working part-time, but would rather be working full-time.	Gallup’s unemployment rate for mid-June is 8.9%. If you add in those who are working part-time, but would like to be working full-time, the total underemployment number in mid-June is 18.6, down from 19.2% at the end of May.

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

In early May, 26% of Americans were satisfied with the way things were
going in this country.	Now, in June, that number has fallen to 20%.	[Gallup 6/11]
