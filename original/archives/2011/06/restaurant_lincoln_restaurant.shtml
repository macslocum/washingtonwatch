<h1>Lincoln Restaurant</h1>
Lincoln Center<br>
142 West 65th Street<br>
NY, NY 10023<br>
Reservations 212-359-6500<br>
<a href="http://www.lincolnrestaurante.com">www.lincolnrestaurante.com</a></div>This restaurant is located on the Lincoln Center Plaza.	The floor-to-high-ceiling, glass, window walls provide a terrific view of the theaters surrounding the plaza and the reflecting pool.
<br><br>
Everything about the restaurant is metal, hard woods and straight lines. However, the seats are much more comfortable than are sometimes found in the “modern” format restaurants.
<br><br>
Debbie and I went to Lincoln with Robie and Bill for lunch before attending a performance of “Warhorse.”	(While WW does not do theater reviews this show is well worth making an effort to attend.)
<br><br>
As her appetizer Robie requested plain asparagus that were offered as part of another dish, followed by Insalata Di Pollo Alla Griglia – chicken breast, arugula, orange, red onion and Parmigiano-Reggiano.
<br><br>
Debbie started with Linguine Alle Vongole – Littleneck and Razor Clams, Pancetta.	For her second course she selected Frittata Di Asparagai E Spugnole, green asparagus, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano.
<br><br>
Bill and I had exactly the same meal.	Acciuga E Radicchio -- anchovy, bibb lettuce, radish, cucumber, salsa tonnata -- followed by Pollo Alla Marsala -- braised chicken legs, crimini mushroom, red bliss potatoes.
<br><br>
Chicken is generally a favorite dish of mine, and this chicken dish was as good, if not better than, any I have ever enjoyed.
<br><br>
Requested modifications of dishes were treated by the server as routine, and when the relevant dish arrived the requested modification had been made.
<br><br>
The service was excellent.	As soon as we were seated we were asked about the time frame of our visit, <em>i.e.</em>, were we going to a show?	And from then on we could not have enjoyed better service.
<br><br>
The restaurant seats about 140 people at tables that seat 2 to 6 people.	These tables can easily be modified to build large tables.	Of particular interest is the open kitchen and bread preparation area.	Both are behind a floor-to-ceiling glass wall.
<br><br>
The restrooms are in the basement.	The obvious course to reach them is a set of stairs to which I was directed by the serving personnel.	However, there is an elevator.
<br><br>
There are six unisex restrooms, in two lines of three, facing each other.	One downside to this particular arrangement is that there is no apparent way to know which of the restrooms is in use except to try each of the doors.	Each of the restrooms has a commode and washbasin.	The interior color is light gray, with a square wall cutout in which are stacked cloth towels.	The floor is covered with large tiles.
<br><br>
The restaurant is open seven days a week for lunch, pre-theater, and dinner. There is also a weekend brunch.
<br><br>
Generally reservations are suggested, but there is a bar that offers the full
menu.
