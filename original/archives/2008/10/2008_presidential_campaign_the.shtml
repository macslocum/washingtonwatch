<p></p>
The financial crisis that has beset the country and the world has swept aside 
all other issues.  52% of Americans say "the economy and jobs," when asked what 
is the most important issue facing the country.  In April 2008, only 23% listed it as 
the most important issue.  The war in Iraq is now listed 3rd, by only 6%, behind 
the second place finisher, health care, at 6%. 
<br><br>
The stock market has been heading down hill for the last year.  On October 
9, 2007, the Dow Jones stood at 14,198.  After hitting a day-end low of 8451, the 
market one year later stood at 8579, a drop of just over 40%.  As of October 17, 
the DOW stands at 9096 at mid-day. 
<br><br>
Most folks do not appreciate how important the underlying credit system is 
to just about everything financial.  Businesses from Main Street to Wall Street, 
and non-profits, including universities and colleges, found that the credit on which 
they depended for regular operations was frozen.  Inventory could not be 
purchased, salaries could not be paid. 
<br><br>
Long-existing investment banks and commercial banks no longer exist as 
stand-alone organizations.  Investment banks became commercial, as well as 
investment banks.  Big banks are being gobbled up by even bigger banks.  The 
venerable Merrill Lunch was acquired by Bank of America. 
<br><br>
One in six homeowners with mortgages find that their homes are worth less 
than the remaining principal on the mortgage. 
[WP 10/9]. 
<br><br>
77% believe the direction of the country is on the wrong track, which is the 
highest number holding that view during the current Administration.  [NBC/WSJ 
10/08]  Said another way, only 7% are satisfied with the direction of the country. 
[Gallop 10/08]
<br><br>
159,000 jobs were lost in September, the worst month in 5 years.  Of equal 
significance, but not getting the same attention, 6.1 million Americans are now 
working part-time because their hours were cut or they could not find full-time 
jobs.  This is the highest number reported since 1933.  [NYT] 
<br><br>
50% say that economic conditions are poor in the country today.  This is up 
21 points in the past month.  90% think conditions are getting worse, a jump of 12 
points in the past month.  [Gallup 10/08] 
<br><br>
For the first time since 1976, more than half of Americans believe they are 
worse off now than they were a year ago.  Looking to next year, 56% are worried 
about their personal financial situation.  76% say it is a bad time to be looking for 
a job.  [Gallop 10/08; NBC/WSJ 10/08] 
<br><br> 
66% say that the crisis of the last month has hurt their current financial 
situation, and 70% believe it will continue to hurt them in the long run.

At a time when the people of this country are desperate to have a leader in 
whom they can have confidence, the cupboard is bare. 
<br><br>
President Bush has an job approval rating of 25%.  This is the lowest of his 
tenure (the high point was 90% in September 2001), and only 1 point higher than 
President Nixon as his low point, and only 3 points higher than President Truman 
when he was in the trough. 
<br><br>
Specifically, on the question of his job performance on the economy, Bush's 
work is disapproved by 74%.  58% feel negatively about him personally.  [Gallop 
10/08; NBC/WSJ 10/08] 
<br><br>
Compared to other two-term Presidents in the last half century, Bush 
continues to remain far behind the others in the approval of the public at this stage 
of their tenures.

28% of Americans say the President is responsible for the current financial 
crisis.  Wall Street and the banks are blamed by 21%.  8% blame the Federal 
Government in Washington and a similar number blame the Congress.

The Congress is in even worse shape than the President in the mind of 
Americans.  Only 13% approve of its work, the lowest rating since 1994, except 
for June of this year.  [NBC/WSJ 10/08] 
The net result is that neither House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Majority 
Leader Harry Reid have the credibility to be national public leaders to whom the 
public will turn.  On the other hand, they are both showing significant success as 
the leaders of their separate institutions. 

<br><br>
Finally, neither of the two candidates for President, Senator Barack Obama 
or Senator John McCain, have so stepped up as to be able to become de facto 
leaders in this time of crisis.

At least nationally, the Democratic Party enjoys a self-identification edge. 
44% identify themselves as Democrats, while 35% say they are Republicans. 
(Both numbers include so-called leaners.)

84% of Americans believe that the next President will face challenges that 
are more serious than what other new Presidents have faced.  44% say these 
challenges are more serious than any faced by a new President in the last 50 years.

There is a certain amount of schizophrenia when it comes to the broad role 
of government and the kind of President folks want. 
<br><br>
47% believe government should do more to solve problems and meet the 
needs of people.  But 45% say the government is doing too many things that are 
better left to business and individuals. 
<br><br>
What do Americans want in the approach to be taken by the new President? 
<br><br>
<ul>

<li>38% say the country needs a President who will provide changes from 
current Bush Administration policies, and a government that is 
into more active oversight in areas such as housing and 
financial transactions </li>
<br>
<li>58% call for a President who will provide changes from current 
policies in Congress and deal with waste and fraud in the 
system to protect taxpayers from government inefficiency and 
pork-barrel spending.   [NBC/WSJ 10/08] </li>

McCain is seen as making decisions too quickly, and Obama is seen as not 
making them quickly enough. [WashPost/ABC 10/08; CBS 10/08]

John McCain's Palin play has played out. The infatuation with Governor 
Sarah Palin has come to an end.  While her selection did serve McCain by 
enabling him to make peace with the conservative wing of the Republican Party, it 
has done nothing for him beyond that service.  However, make no mistake, that was an important assistance to McCain going forward from the Republican 
convention. 
<br><br>
On one level, Palin and Obama's pick, Senator Joe Biden, have had a similar 
impact.  25% of potential voters say they are more likely to vote for McCain 
because Palin is on the ticket.  24% make the same statement about the selection 
of Biden by Obama.  [WP/ABC 10/08] 
<br><br>
But there is where it ends.  While 74% say that Biden is qualified to be Vice 
President and to be next in line for the Presidency, only 41% say that about Palin.
