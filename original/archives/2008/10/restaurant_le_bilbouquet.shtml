<h1>Le Bilbouquet </h1>
25 East 63rd Street <br>
New York, NY</div>Jay and Rita suggested this restaurant for a Saturday lunch in New York. 
<br><br>
It is quite small.  The tables, and thus the patrons, are all but sitting on top 
of each other.  There are a number of tables on the sidewalk. 
<br><br>
When I asked the serving person if there was a copy of the menu I could 
take with me, she rather disdainfully said no. 
<br><br>
Having said all of the above, the service was fine and the food quite good. 
Rita had an endive salad, Jay ordered sliced chicken, and I ordered a sliced 
chicken salad, which was quite good, and included leaf lettuce, green beans, and 
kernels of corn. 
<br><br>
I also opted for a chocolate mousse dessert, which was of a perfect 
consistency and taste. 
<br><br>
But the feature of the restaurant that required that this review be written was 
the men's room.  It was by far the smallest men's room I have ever encountered. 
The small wash basin was all but on top of the small/medium sized commode.  I 
barely managed to get in and close the door.  I am morally certain that at my 
previous size, I either would not have been able to enter the room or, if I did 
accomplish that feat, I likely would not have been able to get out without 
assistance. 
<br><br>
Bottom line, it is worth a try on a sunny Saturday in October. 
<br><br>
[Note: You don't need the telephone number because the restaurant does not 
take reservations.]
