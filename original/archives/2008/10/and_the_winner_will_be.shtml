<p></p>
It is likely that before election day, more than $1 billion dollars will have 
been spent on the Presidential race from beginning to end. 
<br><br>
It turns out that all of that money was probably wasted, as was the work of 
the consultants; campaign staff that were hired; the TV, radio, newspaper, and 
internet advertising; and all of the travel by the candidates and their surrogates. 
<br><br>
In fact, it was probably all over by September 2007.  At least, so says Alan 
J. Lichtman, of American University, and his colleague Volodia Kellis-Borok, a 
Russian authority on the mathematics of prediction models. 
<br><br>
The two men developed the "13 Keys to the White House."  The keys 
accurately predict the popular vote winners of every Presidential election from 
1860-1980 after the fact, and "prospectively the winners of every Presidential 
election from 1984 through 2004." 
<br><br>

The Keys are 13 questions that are stated as "propositions" that favor 
reelection of the incumbent Party.  <u>If five or fewer of these "propositions" are 
false, that Party wins another term in office.  When 6 or more are false the 
incumbent Party loses</u>.
<br><br>
Here are the questions.  Decide for yourself who has already won the 
election. 
<br><br>
<b>Key 1</b> - After the midterm elections, the incumbent Party holds more seats in the 
U.S. House of Representatives than it did after the previous midterm elections. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 2</b> - There is no serious contest for the incumbent Party nomination. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 3</b> - The incumbent Party candidate is the sitting President. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 4</b> - There is no significant third Party or independent campaign. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False_______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 5</b> - The economy is not in recession during the election campaign. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False_______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 6</b> - Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False________ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 7</b> - The incumbent Administration effects major changes in national policy. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False________ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 8</b> - There is no sustained social unrest during the term. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____  False_______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 9</b> - The incumbent Administration is untainted by major scandal. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____   False_______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 10</b> - The incumbent Administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True_____   False________ 
<br><br>

<b>Key 11</b> - The incumbent Administration achieves a major success in foreign or 
military affairs. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True______  False________ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 12</b> - The incumbent Party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True______  False_______ 
<br><br>
<b>Key 13</b> - The challenging Party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True______  False_______ 
<br><br>

Number that are false________ 
<br><br>
The winner is_____________
