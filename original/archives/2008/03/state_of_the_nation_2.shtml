Americans are pessimistic about the country. 
<br><br>
66% say the country is on the wrong track. Only 20% think it

What is abundantly clear is that the economy has replaced 
the war in Iraq as the #1 issue in the minds of Americans.
<br><br>
In a Gallup survey taken March 6-9, respondents were asked 
an open-ended question 
<br><br>
"What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?" 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Economy in general  35% 
<li> Situation in Iraq/war  21% 
<li> Poor healthcare/hospitals/high cost of healthcare 8% 
<li> Fuel/Oil prices   8% 
<li> Immigration/illegal aliens 6% 
<li> Unemployment/jobs 5% 
<li> Dissatisfaction with govt/Congress/politicians etc 5% 
<li> 19 other issues ranging from ethical/moral/religious decline (4%) to Guns/gun control (1%). 
</ul>
<br>
In the NBC/WSJ survey taken March 7-10, respondents were 
given a specific list of issues and were asked "Let me list some issues that have been proposed for the federal government to address. Please tell me which one of these items you think should be the top priority for the federal government." 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Job creation and economic growth 26% 
<li> The war in Iraq 19% 
<li> Health care 12% 
<li> Energy and the cost of gas 10% 
<li> Terrorism 9% 
<li> Illegal immigration 9% 
<li> The environment and global warming 4% 
<li> Foreign policy and Iran 2%          
</ul>
As recently as December 2007 "the war in Iraq" and "health care" were the top issues at 18% each.            
 <br>
<br>

<br>
When it comes to Iraq [Gallup 3/08] 
<br><br>
65% think the U.S. has " an obligation to establish a reasonable level of stability and security" in that country before all American troops are withdrawn. 
<br><br>
63% believe that if U.S. troops are withdrawn, Al Qaeda is "more likely to use Iraq as a base for its terrorist operations. 
<br><br>
57% believe that a greater number of Iraqis will die from violence if U.s. troops are withdrawn. 
<br><br>
Only 18% of Americans believe that U.S. troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible. At the other end of the spectrum are 35% who believe that those troops should be kept there until the situation gets better. 41% favor a set timetable for gradual withdrawal.
<br><br>
A majority (75%) are not optimistic about a speedy withdrawal. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 2 to 3 years - 32% 
<li> 4 to 5 years - 26% 
<li> 6 to 10 years - 17% 
</ul>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

In 2000 65% of Americans thought the United States was the 
leading economic power in the world. China ranked 2nd at 18%. 
There has been a big change. Now (2008) 40% of Americans believe 
that China is the leading economic power with the U.S. in 2nd 
place at 33%. Japan ranked 3rd in both years. [Gallup 2/08] 
<br><br>
And while Americans had a marginally favorable opinion of 
China a year ago - 48% favorable/42% unfavorable - now 53% have 
an unfavorable opinion as opposed to 47% who still feel favorably 
toward that country. 
 <br>
