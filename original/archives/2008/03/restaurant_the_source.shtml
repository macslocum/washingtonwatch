</div>Three trips to "the source", dinner with Virginia and Tom, 
lunch with Carol M, and a reception marking the launch of 
StoreAdore, Meredith Barnett and Christina Miller's new website, 
left me more than happy to return. 
<br><br>
This is Wolfgang Puck's first venture into D.C. and it 
should do very well, particularly once the Newseum, which 
dominates the building in which it is housed, is fully open. 
<br><br>
There are three usable floors, the main floor on which you 
enter the restaurant, a second floor that can be accessed by a 
long staircase or an elevator and a basement which includes a 
room for private parties. 
<br><br>
The main floor seems quite airy and open with windows for 
walls but it pales in comparison to the brightness that comes 
during the daytime from the floor to ceiling windows on two sides 
of the 2nd floor. 
<br><br>
The main floor includes a bar, a counter with high chairs 
and many tables. It seats about 80 folks and the menu is limited 
to smaller dishes. It is the place where the after work crowd 
will congregate. 
<br><br>
The 2nd floor seats about 140 people and has regular menus 
for lunch and dinner. 
<br><br>
There is an Asian flavor to all of the food. 
<br><br>
For the StoreAdore reception the entire 2nd floor was used. 
A variety of tasty finger foods ranging from baby burgers to 
large sauteed shrimp were abundant. 
<br><br>
For lunch Carol M started with Spicy Tuna Tartare, in 
Sesame-Miso Cones, Shaved Bonito, Tobiko. Clever in design and 
tasty. Of course I could not resist starting with Crispy Suckling 
Pig with Bolack Plum Puree, Pickled Cipolini with Sweetbean. 
These are actually small, multi-layer treats that can be eaten 
with a single bite. 
<br><br>
For the main course Carol had an "American Style Kobe 
Burger, with Smoked Onion Marmalade and Herb Aioli. 
<br><br>
My choice was a Maine Lobster Club sandwich with Bacon 
Vinaigrette, Mesclun Mix on Toasted Walnut Bread. There was a 
substantial amount of lobster and the whole combination was 
excellent. 
<br><br>
 At dinner, our appetizers (called First Flavors) were  "Tiny Dumplings" Pork Belly, with Black Vinegar, Chili Oil, Ginger 
Cilantro Leaves; Crispy Calamari Salad, Frisee, Sweet Chili 
Dressing, Lemongrass Dust; and Sauteed Crab Cake & Crab Salad, 
Mango, Thai Vinaigrette and Aromatic Herbs. 
<br><br>
For the main course at dinner, Virginia had Steamed Wild 
King Salmon"Hong Kong Style" Baby Bok Choy, Ginger and Soy. 
<br><br>
Tom selected Grilled 'American Style" Kobe NY Steak, Chinese 
Mustard, Parsnip Puree. (The surprise was a relatively small 
piece of meat for the modest price of $62.) 
<br><br>
I had the Grilled Lamb Chops, with Hunan Egg plant, Pea 
Tendrils, and Chili-Mint Vinaigrette which were absolutely the 
most tasty lamb chops I have ever eaten. 
<br><br>
No surprise, the service was first rate. 
<br><br>
The furniture is quite comfortable and I was particularly 
taken with the fact that the benches, in the booths on the 2nd 
floor moved so that there is no need to squeeze in. 
<br><br>
At the reception and at dinner the restaurant was noisy. 
Lunch time was quieter. And in the evening the dimness of the 
lighting required me to use the tiny flashlight that I carry for 
just such occasions. 
<br><br>
There are men's rooms in the basement and on the 2nd floor. 
There is nothing special about the 2nd floor men's room. I did 
not try the basement facility.  
<br><br>
Surprisingly, it is what is know in the trade as a "one 
holer." It  has a single commode and a washbasin and is 
relatively small. On the other hand it is bright and clean. 
<br><br>
The floor is covered in large gray tiles and the walls are 
covered with large white tiles to a height of about 6 feet. Then 
there is a 2-inch silver stripe that runs around the entire room 
and the balance of the walls and the ceiling are painted white. 
<br><br>
Assuming the women's room is similar in size and facility, 
that means that in a pinch women could use the men's room and men 
could use the women's room. 
<br><br>
Don't let the address fool you. Entrance to the restaurant 
is on the 6th Street side of the building. Reservations are 
recommended. There is valet parking in the evening.
