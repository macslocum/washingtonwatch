<h1>Town Hall Delicatessen</h1>
60 Valley Street <br>
South Orange, NJ <br>
973-762-0707</div>
[Note: After seeing the review of <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/05/restaurant_noahs_ark_original.shtml">Noah's Ark</a> in the last issue, the following was 
submitted by Jim Gerstenzang.  It appears without edit.] 
<br><br>
Your item on the NY deli brought this story to mind: For decades, the best deli I 
encountered was in South Orange, N.J. (I grew up next door in Maplewood.) 
<br><br>
The Town Hall Delicatessen was owned by a German-American family.  The 
Grandmother worked the cash register, the sons and grandsons (one grandson was a class 
mate of mine) worked behind the counter.  There were open pickle barrels.  Fresh Breads. 
The fragrance was marvelous. 
<br><br>
I was crushed to discover about two years ago that it had closed; I'd made a detour 
off the Garden State Parkway enroute from Boston to DC for a sandwich.  I found out 
that the Joost family had sold the store/restaurant.  The good news: A new owner was 
reopening the deli nearby, with the original menu and recipes. 
<br><br>
I returned last week.  I wasn't disappointed.  The sandwich for which Town Hall 
was famous was back on the menu.  That would be Sloppy Joe.  This is not the "Sloppy 
Joe" of ground meat and gravy or chili or whatever goo that the name brings to mind 
elsewhere. 
<br><br>
It is this: 
<br><br>
Three pieces of thinly sliced NY Jewish Rye bread.  The loaf is sliced horizontally, 
rather than vertically, creating--when the rounded edges are squared off -- a rectangular 
sheet of rye.  It makes a sandwich that is easily sufficient for two servings. The filling is 
any choice of meats -- the original, tongue, was not for my palate.  With Genie Wetstein 
and Jon Kantor, we ordered two sandwiches; roast beef on one, turkey on another.  But 
what makes the sandwich special is the whole combination: the meat, the Swiss cheese, 
the cole slaw, the Russian dressing, and the thinly sliced bread. Somehow, the 
combination and the proportions make for a sandwich I have never been able to match (or 
make) elsewhere. [Sloppy Joes need to be ordered in advance.] 
<br><br>
As Michelin would say, it is worth the detour.  It's still the best deli sandwich I've 
had.  <i>-- Jim</i>

                                 About polling: WW has passed this reminder to its readers before, but it is worth 
doing again.  As the campaign season escalates there will be hundreds of polls.  Many of 
them are sponsored by substantial organizations with high standards, like NBC/WSJ, 
WP/ABC, CBS/NYT, Newsweek, LATimes Bloomberg, Cook/RT, etc.  And then there 
are surveys taken on the cheap by a variety of entities whose goal, as much as anything, is 
to get their name in the news cycle. 
<br><br>
Then there are surveys of all adults, registered voters, and, closer to the election, 
likely voters.  Be mindful of the group that is being surveyed. 
<br><br>
All of which is to say, consider the source before you rely in any substantial way 
on surveys that come to your attention.

40% of Americans have gotten campaign news and information from the internet 
so far during the election season.  Only 31% could say that at this time in 2004.  6% go 
online for this purpose daily, while 19% go on at least once a week.  [Pew Research 
Center 2008]

<b>Reilly's Rules</b> (John Reilly that is) 
<br><br>
<i>Rule # 1</i> - In a campaign, if you ever receive a "contribution" in an envelope which 
consists of four $100 bills, you can be certain that the person giving you the envelope has 
"nicked" either $100 or $600, because nobody in political history ever gave anybody 
$400. 
<br><br>
<i>Rule # 2</i> - In every campaign you will ever be in, there will always be somebody on Your 
Side that you wish devoutly was on the Other Side. 
<br><br>
<i>Rule # 3</i> - You can fool some of the people all of the time, and those are the ones on who 
you have to concentrate.

It appears that in their Federal political giving, "Bermans" favor Democrats by a 
substantial margin.  According to <a href="http://Fundrace08.Huffingtonpost.com">Fundrace08.Huffingtonpost.com</a>, as of May 31, 2008, 
persons with the last name of "Berman" contributed to Democrats over Republicans at a 
ratio of $2 to $1 during this 2007-08 cycle.

A family went to one of those restaurants where the walls are plastered with movie 
memorabilia.  The woman of the family went to see the hostess about reserving a table. 
When she returned she found her 11-year-old-daughter staring at a poster of Superman 
standing in a phone booth.  She looked puzzled. 
<br><br>
She asked her husband, "Doesn't she know who Superman is." "Worse," he 
replied, "she doesn't know what a phone booth is."

</div>The Kemble Park Tavern, is located in the same space as the now-gone Starlight 
Cafe.  There the similarity ends.  The ambiance, the seating, and the food are totally 
different. Frankly, not better or worse, but different. 
<br><br>
I have eaten at Kemble Park three times.  First, with Rita and Bob; then with Rita, 
Bob and Hilary; and finally with Sherry and Mike. 
<br><br>
There are two entrances to the restaurant, both on MacArthur Boulevard, and both 
requiring going up a set of stairs.  There is a patio that seats about 20 people at tables of 
four that I am sure is quite pleasant in the Spring and Fall, but that I think should be 
avoided in a typical Washington summer. 
<br><br>
Once inside, there is an area at the front of the restaurant that has a series of high 
tables and chairs that seats from 2 - 6 people.  There is also a full bar with large, armed, 
high chairs. 
<br><br>
The main dining room has two sections.  The first is divided into three types of 
seating areas that run the length of the room. 
<br><br>
To the left is a long banquette that runs the length of the room and appeared quite 
comfortable.  The tables which front the banquette have comfortable chairs.  The tables 
can be used as deuces, quads or even longer combinations. 
<br><br>
Running down the middle of the room are a series of deuces, each with very high, 
extremely comfortable chairs, set lengthwise. 
<br><br>
And finally on the right hand wall there is a series of 4-person booths. 
<br><br>
At the far end of the restaurant is a separate room, with glass walls separating it 
from the main dining room.  It holds four 4-person tables.
<br><br>
Overall, the restaurant seats 100 people for dinner, plus the patio when it is in use. 
<br><br>
The dinner menu includes appetizers, sandwiches, salads, entrees, and sides. 
<br><br>
During these meals my companions and I have enjoyed Gazpacho soup, Matzo 
Ball Soup, Caesar Salad, Short Rib Sliders, Tomato, Onion, Wedge Salad and Mixed 
Greens, the Grilled Burger, the Pulled Chicken sandwich, the Marinated Seafood Salad, 
Bay Rockfish, the Baked Potato, Bok Choy, Hand Cut Fries, and Seasonal Vegetables. 
<br><br>
The menu provides an opportunity to select a single dish or a combination of 
dishes that allows you to meet your appetite of the moment.  For example, on one evening 
I had the Tomato, Wedge Salad, a Baked Potato, Bok Choy, and Seasonal Vegetables. 
<br><br>
Only Sherry and Mike were burger eaters among this group, but they claim the 
burgers are excellent, with or without a bun. Particular note was made of the burgers 
having a proper firm outside with a red and tender inside. 
<br><br>
If your inclination is for a double espresso after dinner, you might want to bring 
your own cup.  When I requested a double espresso at the end of my second dinner the 
waiter explained that they did not have a cup that would hold a double espresso.  I 
suggested that he bring me two single cups of espresso, which he did.  I must admit that I 
began to pour the espresso from one cup to the other to see whether it would hold a 
double.  He was right, the individual cups are not big enough.  I wonder what they would 
do if, as I have sometimes done, I ordered a quad? 
<br><br>
The service left nothing to be desired. 
<br><br>
Unisex restrooms are the standard.  I happen to have used the same restroom all 
three times, the alternate restroom always being busy. 
<br><br>
The restroom I used is quite small.  Immediately upon entry, to your left, is a dark 
wood hamper next to a round, white ceramic wash basin in a white marble top, set on a 
dark wood cabinet.  The wall opposite the washbasin holds a large oval mirror. 
<br><br>
Directly ahead is a small, completely enclosed, commode room with a black 
wooden door.  The commode is a standard white ceramic model. 
<br><br>
The walls are completely covered with a green background floral pattern and the 
floor is covered with mid-sized, multi- colored, brownish tiles. 
<br><br>
The restroom seems to be well maintained. 
<br><br>
There is valet parking in the evening.

I don't understand how I can lie awake for three hours in the middle of the night 
trying to sleep in a large king-sized bed in a quiet room, and then sit in a straightback, 
uncomfortable barber's chair in a noisy barber shop, with the barber buzzing around my 
head with an electric razor, using his scissors hither and yon, and falling sound asleep.

However, the job performance rating of the Congress, both Houses of
which are controlled by the Democrats, continues to be in the basement.
<br>
<br>
The NBC/WSJ survey referenced above shows that 79% disapprove of the
job Congress is doing, with a paltry 13% approving its work. This is
the worst performance rating in the history of that poll. <br>
<br>
Recent surveys by Fox News, Gallup, and AP-Ipsos found an average
disapproval of 72% and an approval of 20%. <br>
<br>
In yet another measurement of attitudes toward the Congress, Gallup
finds that confidence in the Congress is the lowest it has found for
any institution in the 35 years it has been testing confidence in
various U.S. institutions. <br>
<br>
Only 12% have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the
Congress. As recently as May 2004, that number was 30%. Back in May
1973 it was 42%. <br>
<br>
As a matter of comparison, in 2008 HMOs are rated at 13%, big business
at 20%, the Presidency at 26%, and the military is at the top of the
list with 71%. <br>
<br>
[Military 71%, small business 60%, the police 58%, church or organized
religion 48%, the medical system 35%, public schools 33%, U.S. Supreme
Court 32%, banks 32%, Presidency 26%, TV news 24%, newspapers 24%,
organized labor 20%, criminal justice system 20%, big business 20%,
HMOs 13%, Congress 12%.] <br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 49 </li>
  <li> Republicans 49 </li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem) </li>
</ul>
<br>
It appears that the low water mark for the Democrats in the coming
Senate races is 53. Assuming the two Independents continue to caucus
with the Democrats, Majority Leader Harry Reid, will have 55 votes for
his re-election as leader. <br>
<br>
The total number of Senate races this year has grown to 35 as a result
of there being two Senate seats on the ballot in Mississippi and
Wyoming this year. In Mississippi Roger Wicker was appointed to fill
the seat vacated early by Senator Trent Lott. John Bassaro was
appointed to the Wyoming seat vacated by the death of Senator Craig
Thomas. <br>
<br>
Among the 6 Toss Up races, Democrats are likely to capture Colorado,
New Hampshire and New Mexico. <br>
<br>
As of today, Minnesota is likely to stay in Republican hands. Al
Franken, who recently secured the Democratic endorsement has had a
series of missteps. These include failure to pay certain taxes in
States other than Minnesota, and exposure of some of his comedy
routines and statements from yesteryear. <br>
<br>
Surprisingly, the race in Mississippi appears to be dead even. The
Democratic candidate will be helped by what is likely to be the largest
turnout of African-Americans in the State's history. <br>
<br>
The other even race is Alaska. A variety of scandals have tarnished
long-serving incumbent Ted Stevens (R), and Mark Begich the Democratic
Mayor of Anchorage, is doing well. <br>
<br>
So, the potential for the Democrats today is 57 seats, just 3 seats
short of a theoretically filibuster proof majority. <br>

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>

  <li> Democrats 236 </li>
  <li> Republicans 199 </li>
</ul>
<br>
Generally speaking, the question does not seem to be whether the Democrats will 
pick up House seats in the 2008, but how many seats will be added to their current 
majority. 
<br><br>
For the sake of argument, assume that the Democrats go into election day having 
as a base all of the solid, likely and leaning Democratic seats (they will probably lose a 
few), a total of 238 seats. 
<br><br>
That leaves the current 26 Toss Up seats. 
<br><br>
Of the 7 Toss Up seats that are currently held by Democrats, all of them have 
Republican PVIs* averaging +8.0. 
<br><br>
Of the 19 Toss Up seats currently held by Republicans, 7 have PVIs of D+2.7. The 
remaining 12 seats have PVIs of +3.8. 
<br><br>
Boiled down, of the 26 Toss Up seats 19 of them have Republican PVIs. 
<br><br>
WW's best guess at the moment - 8 to 17 Democratic pickups.

                                 <h2>Democratic Primary</h2>
Act VII, which turned out to be the final act, opened on May 7th and
finished on Saturday, June 7th. Hillary Clinton won 4 of the last 6
primaries held during the period, but it was not enough. <br>
<br>
By the 3rd week of May, Barack Obama was able to claim that he had won
a majority of the elected delegates. On the night of June 3rd, as the
last primaries concluded, Obama was able to claim victory with a
combination of elected and automatic delegates. <br>
<br>
On June 7th, in a speech that was her best of the campaign, Clinton
gave Obama her unqualified endorsement and called on her supporters to
stand up for him. But of equal, if not greater, import, she talked
about and to those American women, who in her candidacy, for the first
time in a long time, if ever, found their champion and leader. <br>
<br>
But between her June 3rd speech and her speech on the 7th, Clinton was
subjected to a variety of criticisms from public figures (who should
have known better) and others who believed that she should have
conceded the race on Tuesday night. <br>
<br>
Public officials, in particular, should have appreciated and understood
Clinton's need for a little time. A person who runs for President is by
definition a dreamer. When their quest for President comes to an end,
that dream is quashed. And the closer the person comes to realizing
that dream, the harder is the loss. They should be given a little time
to deal with that loss. <br>
<br>
Her delay had no adverse affect on Barack Obama's campaign. Even if she
had waited a few days longer, it would not have affected his campaign.
To his credit, Obama counseled everyone to just relax. <br>
<br>

<h2>The Encore</h2>
August 28th, will be a historic night in this country. On that night an
African- American will accept the nomination of a major political
party, the Democratic Party. <br>
<br>
It is also the 45th Anniversary of Martin Luther King's "I have a
Dream" speech. <br>
<br>
Between now and the convention there will be a certain amount of sturm
and drang. How will Hillary be treated at the convention, which is now
under the control of the Obama campaign? Will she have her name placed
in nomination (it only requires the signature of 300 delegates)? <br>
<br>
As many will recall, in 1980, the Kennedy forces made a run at a rules
change that they thought might enable Kennedy to beat Carter. When the
Carter forces handily won the relevant vote, Kennedy decided not to
have his name placed in nomination. Nonetheless, Kennedy received 1150
votes on the first ballot. <br>
<br>
In 1984, with Walter Mondale a clear winner (2191 votes) going into the
convention, Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson each received votes on the
first ballot, Hart received 1201 and Jackson 466. <br>
<br>
Here are the 1st ballot results of several other recent Democratic
conventions. <br>
<br>
<b>1976</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Carter 2239 </li>
  <li>Udall 330 </li>
  <li>Tsongas 301
  </li>
</ul>
<b>1988</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Dukakis 2877 </li>
  <li>Jackson 1219 </li>
</ul>
<b>1992</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Clinton 3372 </li>
  <li> Brown 596 </li>
  <li> Tsongas 289 </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
At least on the surface, the healing has begun between Obama and
Clinton. Several nights ago Clinton brought Obama to a meeting of her
principal fundraisers. Obama made the right gesture in making his
maximum personal contribution to help retire her debt. <br>
<br>
In coming weeks Clinton will be on the road in support of Obama's
candidacy, and she will have a prominent role at the convention whether
or not she is the Vice Presidential nominee. <br>
<br>

It is unlikely that any candidate other than McCain will get a
significant number of votes at the Republican convention. <br>

<h2>The General Election</h2>
The general election campaign has begun. At the rate that McCain and
Obama and their teams are exchanging charges and countercharges, either
they or the public are going to be very tired long before election day.

While WW does not believe that surveys this early in the game mean very
much, here is the lay of the land in the race for President. <br>

In looking for reasons to explain the difference in the polls, WW
looked at the partisan nature of the samples used in three of the
surveys. It did not provide an answer. <br>
<br>
Newsweek and Washington Post/ABC tend to be pretty close in the number
of Democrats and Republicans in their samples. The NBC/WSJ survey
includes fewer identified Democrats and a greater number of
Independents. <br>

Looking back, the general elections in 2004, 2000 and 1996 had the
following cast to them, as recorded by the Gallup Survey. <br>

50% say that it is more important for a candidate for President to
represent "new direction and new ideas," as opposed to 43% who say that
"strength and experience" is most important. [WP/ABC 6/08] <br>
<br>
Here is a list of qualities and how the American public thinks about
McCain and Obama in relation to them. % represents those who rated them
5 or 4 on a 5 point scale. 5 is very good. [NBC/WSJ 6/08] <br>
<br>
The two men are rated about equally on being honest and
straightforward. McCain has the advantage when it comes to experience,
leadership qualities, and being commander-in-chief. Obama is tops in
being easy-going and likeable, being inspirational, bringing change,
and sharing their positions on issues. <br>

<h2>The Electoral College</h2>
A variety of organizations have begun analyzing the Electoral College.
After all the election is about electoral votes, not popular votes. <br>
<br>
WW does not have the resources to do the complicated analysis that many
organizations use. The WW approaches the contest as follows. [<a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/African Am Pop and 92-04 Election Chart.xls">See
attachment</a>.] <br>
<br>
If Obama simply wins all of the States that have been won by the
Democratic candidate in the last 4 Presidential elections (1992, 1996,
2000, and 2004) he will have 248 electoral votes. <br>
<br>
Using the same standard for McCain, but substituting States that have
gone Republican in the last 4 Presidential elections, he has 135 votes.
<br>
<br>
Then WW gives to McCain those states which have been won by Republicans
in 3 of the last 4 elections, including in 2000 and 2004. That gives
him an additional 64 votes for a total of 199. <br>
<br>
There are 3 States which have been won by the Democrat in 3 of the last
4 elections, but in none of those States did the Democrat win in 2000
and 2004. <br>
<br>
So there are 91 electoral votes in play: the 3 States (16 electoral
votes) in which Democrats have won 3 of the last 4; and the 75
electoral votes which have split 2 for 2 in the last 4 elections, but
in each of those States the Republicans have won in the last 2
elections. This is the field from which Obama must find 25 electoral
votes and McCain must find 71. <br>
<br>
In the group of States with 64 electoral votes which WW has assigned to
McCain, available polling shows McCain leading in 3, Obama leading in
1, and no public polls available in the 5th, which happens to be
Arizona, so it is not unrealistic to give that to McCain. Thus McCain
leads in 4 of 5, totaling 55 votes, with 9 votes slated for Obama's
camp. <br>
<br>
In the group of 75 electoral votes that have split 2/2 in the last 4
Presidential elections, there is no publicly available polling in 4 of
8 of these States. One State, Nevada, is even. McCain leads in 2 states
and Obama leads in one. So, McCain has 20 votes, Obama has 20 votes,
and 35 votes are in the air. <br>
<br>
In the group of 16 votes in which 3 of the last 4 elections have been
won by the Democrat, 1 State is even, leaving its 4 votes in play. The
other two, boasting 12 votes, are in the Obama column. <br>
<br>
So, after all of the above <i>guesstimating</i>, the
electoral votes are allocated by WW as follows:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Obama 289 </li>
  <li> McCain 210 </li>
  <li> TossUps 39 </li>
</ul>
If you want to play the electoral vote game most of the news websites
allow you to manipulate at will. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h2>The Financing Flap</h2>
There is a high level of dyspepsia among editorial writers, columnists
and assorted groups because Obama has decided to forego Federal
financing for his general election campaign. <br>
<br>
Their angst is in defense of a broken "system". They are upset because
earlier in the campaign Obama made statements that he would consider
limiting his general election campaign financing to the Federal grant
that would be delivered under that broken system. <br>
<br>
There was no particular angst when Obama, Clinton and McCain eschewed
the matching fund system in the primaries. After all each of them would
have been allowed under the system to spend $42 million between January
2007 - August 2008. <br>
<br>
And there didn't seem to be much consternation when the McCain campaign
appeared to game the system by using the fact that he was eligible for
matching funds as collateral for establishing a loan or line of credit.
<br>
<br>
Rather than being upset with Obama, they should be pleased to learn
that he is a candidate who learns. He learned enough during the primary
campaign to realize that the Federal grant - $84.1 million - is not
enough to do the job that needs to be done. And oh, by the way, he has
so turned on the American body politic that he does not have to limit
himself in this way. <br>
<br>
If Obama is to be criticized it is for the convoluted reasoning by
which he and his campaign explained the decision. They talked about all
the money that the McCain campaign and the Republican National
Committee was getting from lobbyists and Pacs. They talked about all of
the groups on the conservative side of the spectrum whose potential
attacks his campaign might have to overcome. <br>
<br>
According to FactCheck.Org, contributions from "lobbyists and PACS"
make up less than 1.7% of the money that has been taken in by the
McCain campaign, and less than 1.1% of the RNC's receipts. <br>
<br>
As to all those groups on the right, they seem to be having a hard time
getting going this year. Even assuming that they do, in 2004 the
amounts of money spent by such groups on the liberal side of the
equation were far more than those on the conservative side. <br>
<br>
To be sure, Obama has asked those with a liberal bent to cease and
desist. Move.org has responded by closing its Sec. 527 side, but the
independent expenditures by its PAC will continue. <br>
<br>
It would have been better if the campaign was up front about its
reasoning. There is a huge job to be done. Just awakening that 45+% of
the potential electorate which does not play in elections will cost
more than the Federal grant will ever permit. <br>
<br>
And, by the way, the costs associated with campaigning have grown at a
greater rate than the CPI, which is the basis for the growth in the
amount available under the Federal grant. An example would be the cost
of primetime TV commercials. Their cost has grown beyond the rate of
the CPI. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
McCain intends to take the Federal grant, although he now has a
perfectly good reason to opt out, should he choose to do so. The
question for McCain is whether his fundraising machine can match
Obama's. <br>
<br>
Currently, his fundraising capability has been improving
month-to-month, and he is engaged in a joint fundraising effort with
the Republican National Committee. <br>
<br>
The best bet is that he will not risk competing with Obama on the money
side during the general election. Between now and the Republican
convention he will raise and spend as much as possible as primary
expenditures. He will then push his fundraisers to turn to the RNC. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Obama is making a big bet, that his fundraising machine will respond
for the general election. <br>
<br>
He is betting that his previous contributors, and others to be added,
will continue to finance his "primary" campaign efforts and in addition
will respond for the general. <br>
<br>
According to Gallup, there has been a drop in enthusiasm about voting
since Super Tuesday, from 63%, who were at the time more enthusiastic
than usual, to 48%, who have that view at the present time. Among
Democrats the drop has been from 79% to 61% and among Republicans from
44% to 35%. <br>
<br>
Notably, in mid-July 2004 enthusiasm for the election was considerably
higher than it is today. 60% were more enthusiastic than usual about
the election. 68% of Democrats and 51% of Republicans fell into this
category. <br>
<br>
The $64 question is whether this drop in enthusiasm will impact Obama's
fundraising. Over the months of March, April and May, Obama's total
contributions received has declined. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Once Obama spends the first dollar from his general election account,
which he may well do before the general election starts, he gives up
the right to request Federal funds. <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Any unencumbered funds which the Obama campaign has left in its primary
account at the start of the general election, August 29th, can be
rolled over and used in the general election. <br>
<br>
For example, if the campaign happens to have on hand at the end of the
primary season, $50,000,000 net of outstanding obligations, that money
can be rolled over into its general election account. <br>
<br>
This roll-over does not in any way affect the ability of a maxed-out
Obama primary voter to max out to Obama's general election campaign.
(The contribution is subject to the individual contributor's aggregate
contribution limit.) <br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Both campaigns can specifically direct approximately $18,500,00 in
spending by their respective national political parties. Other than
that, Party spending cannot be coordinated with the Presidential
campaigns. <br>
