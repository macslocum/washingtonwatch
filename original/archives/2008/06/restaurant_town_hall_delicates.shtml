[Note: After seeing the review of <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/05/restaurant_noahs_ark_original.shtml">Noah's Ark</a> in the last issue, the following was 
submitted by Jim Gerstenzang.  It appears without edit.] 
<br><br>
Your item on the NY deli brought this story to mind: For decades, the best deli I 
encountered was in South Orange, N.J. (I grew up next door in Maplewood.) 
<br><br>
The Town Hall Delicatessen was owned by a German-American family.  The 
Grandmother worked the cash register, the sons and grandsons (one grandson was a class 
mate of mine) worked behind the counter.  There were open pickle barrels.  Fresh Breads. 
The fragrance was marvelous. 
<br><br>
I was crushed to discover about two years ago that it had closed; I'd made a detour 
off the Garden State Parkway enroute from Boston to DC for a sandwich.  I found out 
that the Joost family had sold the store/restaurant.  The good news: A new owner was 
reopening the deli nearby, with the original menu and recipes. 
<br><br>
I returned last week.  I wasn't disappointed.  The sandwich for which Town Hall 
was famous was back on the menu.  That would be Sloppy Joe.  This is not the "Sloppy 
Joe" of ground meat and gravy or chili or whatever goo that the name brings to mind 
elsewhere. 
<br><br>
It is this: 
<br><br>
Three pieces of thinly sliced NY Jewish Rye bread.  The loaf is sliced horizontally, 
rather than vertically, creating--when the rounded edges are squared off -- a rectangular 
sheet of rye.  It makes a sandwich that is easily sufficient for two servings. The filling is 
any choice of meats -- the original, tongue, was not for my palate.  With Genie Wetstein 
and Jon Kantor, we ordered two sandwiches; roast beef on one, turkey on another.  But 
what makes the sandwich special is the whole combination: the meat, the Swiss cheese, 
the cole slaw, the Russian dressing, and the thinly sliced bread. Somehow, the 
combination and the proportions make for a sandwich I have never been able to match (or 
make) elsewhere. [Sloppy Joes need to be ordered in advance.] 
<br><br>
As Michelin would say, it is worth the detour.  It's still the best deli sandwich I've 
had.  <i>-- Jim</i>
