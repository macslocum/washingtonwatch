</div>In the ordinary course WW does not review or otherwise comment on stage 
or theatrical productions.  And it is unlikely that the readers of WW would be 
interested in the tastes of your editor.  However, for the first time in the 23 years (!) in which some form of the WW has been published, your editor is making a recommendation.  It is not likely to happen again. 
<br><br>
This show has been running, in various iterations and in various places in 
the city, for some 34 years. 
<br><br>
On the night that Jay, Rita, Simma, Ron, and I attended the subject of its 
humor was both dated and contemporary. 
<br><br>
There is no way to describe the show, except to say that all 5 of us laughed 
or giggled pretty much non-stop throughout the 90-minute performance. 
<br><br>
Just take WW's word for it, go to the show.  It is worth the price of 
admission.  To be safe, order your tickets in advance. 
<br><br>
As you will note from the performance schedule below, persons under the 
age of 21 may only attend certain performances. This is not a show for children. 
Beer, wine, soft drinks, and some caloric nibbles are available. 
<br><br>
<b>Performance times </b><br>
Wednesday and Thursday 8:00 p.m. <br>
Friday and  Saturday 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. <br>
Sunday 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. <br>
<br>
Persons under 21 are only admitted to the Sunday matinee
