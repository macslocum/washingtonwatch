<h1>Rocco's Cafe</h1>
South of Market Street <br>
1131 Folsom Street, between 7th & 8th <br>

<a href="http://www.roccoscafe.com">www.roccoscafe.com</a></div>This is a neighborhood joint that Stanley selected for my first breakfast in 
San Francisco. The place looks like it has been there for decades, but at least this 
location opened in 1990. 
<br><br>
Breakfast, lunch and dinner is served.  The menu is endless.  There are 11 
different omelettes, 5 kinds of fritiatas, and about 8 additional egg combinations, 
in addition to the omelettes.  And then of course, there are a half dozen kinds of 
pancakes, waffles, and French toast, and the usual list of meats. 
<br><br>
While WW is not going to layout the entire lunch and dinner menus, there 
are 19 kinds of pasta, along with 12 sandwiches, plus a flock of other entrees on 
the luncheon menu.  And, yes, they do have take-out and offer delivery. 
<br><br>
When we arrived at about 7:45 a.m. there was ample parking on the street. 
The small supermarket that is located next door to Rocco's had opened the large 
metal gate that covered its front door. 
<br><br>
It seats about 50-60 people with small 2 person tables that can obviously be 
configured for whatever size group comes through the door. 
<br><br>
As you enter, you see to the left a large L-shaped counter and the open 
kitchen that seems to fill the back quarter of the restaurant.  The walls are covered 
with framed pictures of everything from movie stars to you name it. 
<br><br>
Stanley chose a half cantaloupe (very large) with bananas and cottage 
cheese.  I selected the Denver omelette, made with egg whites.  The omelette was 
excellent, but the size could easily feed two people.  I did not finish it.  I also had 
cottage cheese and tomatoes on the side, rather than toast and potatos. 
<br><br>
I also had an excellent hot chocolate.  Stanley stuck with coffee, and when 
he noted that it was not very hot, the serving person apologized and made a fresh 
pot. 
<br><br>
There is a unisex restroom.  It fits the rest of the restaurant.  There is a 
reddish door that has the word "Restroom" on a plaque in the middle.  Another 
sign says "This is not an exit."  I entered.  The entire restroom is not larger than 4 
feet wide and 6 feet long.  Immediately to the left is a single white ceramic 
commode.  Directly ahead is a small white ceramic wash basin.  Directly to the 
right there is a wooden door that is slightly ajar.  I glanced through the door and 
saw a narrow set of stairs heading into the basement. The floor is covered with 
mid-sized black tiles, and the walls are covered with multi- colored tiles in shapes 
that are not quite squares and not quite triangles.  The restroom is not as dingy as 
some we have seen, I would still put it in the group.
