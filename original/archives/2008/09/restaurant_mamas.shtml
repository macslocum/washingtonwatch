<h1>Mama's on Washington Square</h1>
1701 Stockton Street <br>
San Francisco, California 94133 <br>
415-362-6421 <br>
<a href="http://mamas-sf.com/">www.mamas-sf.com</a></div>If you decide to try Mama's, which WW recommends that you do, wear 
comfortable shoes; it is inevitable that you will spend some time waiting in line. There is the line outside the restaurant to get in, and the line leading to the location 
at which you place your order and pay.  After paying, you may stand around for a 
while before you get a place to sit down.  However, once inside you can entertain 
yourself watching the cooking process. 
<br><br>
Mama's is open from 8 a.m.-3 p.m., Tuesday - Sunday.  There is seating for 
about 45 people on two levels.  With the exception of a couple of tables that can 
handle up to 6 people, the other tables are for two, but are regularly moved 
together or apart depending on the size of parties that are waiting to be seated. 
<br><br>
Stan, Jay and I arrived at Mama's at about 8:20 a.m. and there was already a 
line.  Stanley has a fairly complicated formula for figuring out each wave of 
diners, so that you wait outside for the shortest period of time.  It is obvious that 
the formula is flawed. 
<br><br>
WW's advice is, be prepared to be patient.  This is not the place to go if you 
are looking for a quick bite. 
<br><br>
The centerpiece of the restaurant is the open kitchen, where a head chef and 
2 assistants seem to be in perpetual motion.  The menus are hung on the walls 
above the kitchen.  [If you go online you can print out a menu in advance sans the daily specials.  The daily specials are written on two small whiteboards, one that 
shows through the window so you can see it from outside, and the other over the 
chef's head.] 
<br><br>
On average, the restaurant serves 290 people a day, which means each chair 
turns over 6 times a day. 
<br><br>
Once you order and are assigned a table, your meal is served to you by one 
of 4 serving people.  I could not quite figure out the system they used to know 
where meals were to go as they came off the cooking line.  I forgot to ask, but 
whatever the system it seemed to be unerring. 
<br><br>
For some reason, Stanley has gone healthy in his eating habits.  You'll recall 
that at <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_roccos_cafe.shtml">Rocco's</a> he ordered cantaloupe, bananas and cottage cheese.  At Mama's he 
ordered bananas, blue berries and plain yogurt. 
<br><br>
Happily, Jay did not succumb to Stanley's new habits, and ordered the 
Smoked salmon scramble with green onions, bagel and cream cheese, and an 
orange juice. 
<br><br>
Throwing care to the wind for a second time, I ordered the French Toast 
Sampler plate with 3 kinds of french toast - cranberry orange walnut, banana nut, and Swedish cinnamon topped with bananas and mixed berries and a side of 
bacon.  All of it was excellent. 
<br><br>
There is a full menu of breakfast treats, including such weekend specials as 
Dungeness Crab Omelette with Avocado and Sour Cream or a Shrimp and 
Avocado Benedict with Grilled tomatoes. 
<br><br>
There is also a more limited luncheon menu, ranging from a traditional 
hamburger to a California sandwich described as Avocado, Tomato, Red Onion, 
and Jack Cheese on whole grain bread with salad. 
<br><br>
I did not check out the restrooms.  It seemed like too much work to get 
through the crowd to get to the back of the restaurant, where I assume they were 
located.
