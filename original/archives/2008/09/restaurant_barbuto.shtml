</div>This interesting little restaurant was suggested by Lisa, with whom I had a delightful lunch. 
<br><br>
On the day we were there the weather was totally suitable for eating outside. 
The way this restaurant is constructed is the front wall consists of two very large overhead sliding garage doors. When the weather is appropriate, as it was that day, 
the front and the side of the restaurant were fully open. 
<br><br>
The menu changes every day.  On the day we were there for lunch the menu 
included a mix of items that made it possible to select items that are more 
traditionally eaten at breakfast, like eggs or pancakes, or lunch, like salads and 
pastas. 
<br><br>
Lisa selected the insalata Manzo - seared hanger steak, arugula, frisee, 
shallot & pecorino.  I opted for gnocchi con granturco - crisp potato dumplings, 
corn, scallions & Pecorino Romano.  Lisa had sorbet and I had ice cream to finish 
off the meal.  Based on those meals we both felt we would opt to eat there again. 
<br><br>
There appeared to be about 40 seats available.  The service was quite good.
