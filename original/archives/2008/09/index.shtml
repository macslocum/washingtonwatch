</div>In the ordinary course WW does not review or otherwise comment on stage 
or theatrical productions.  And it is unlikely that the readers of WW would be 
interested in the tastes of your editor.  However, for the first time in the 23 years (!) in which some form of the WW has been published, your editor is making a recommendation.  It is not likely to happen again. 
<br><br>
This show has been running, in various iterations and in various places in 
the city, for some 34 years. 
<br><br>
On the night that Jay, Rita, Simma, Ron, and I attended the subject of its 
humor was both dated and contemporary. 
<br><br>
There is no way to describe the show, except to say that all 5 of us laughed 
or giggled pretty much non-stop throughout the 90-minute performance. 
<br><br>
Just take WW's word for it, go to the show.  It is worth the price of 
admission.  To be safe, order your tickets in advance. 
<br><br>
As you will note from the performance schedule below, persons under the 
age of 21 may only attend certain performances. This is not a show for children. 
Beer, wine, soft drinks, and some caloric nibbles are available. 
<br><br>
<b>Performance times </b><br>
Wednesday and Thursday 8:00 p.m. <br>
Friday and  Saturday 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. <br>
Sunday 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. <br>
<br>
Persons under 21 are only admitted to the Sunday matinee

<h1>Mama's on Washington Square</h1>
1701 Stockton Street <br>
San Francisco, California 94133 <br>
415-362-6421 <br>
<a href="http://mamas-sf.com/">www.mamas-sf.com</a></div>If you decide to try Mama's, which WW recommends that you do, wear 
comfortable shoes; it is inevitable that you will spend some time waiting in line. There is the line outside the restaurant to get in, and the line leading to the location 
at which you place your order and pay.  After paying, you may stand around for a 
while before you get a place to sit down.  However, once inside you can entertain 
yourself watching the cooking process. 
<br><br>
Mama's is open from 8 a.m.-3 p.m., Tuesday - Sunday.  There is seating for 
about 45 people on two levels.  With the exception of a couple of tables that can 
handle up to 6 people, the other tables are for two, but are regularly moved 
together or apart depending on the size of parties that are waiting to be seated. 
<br><br>
Stan, Jay and I arrived at Mama's at about 8:20 a.m. and there was already a 
line.  Stanley has a fairly complicated formula for figuring out each wave of 
diners, so that you wait outside for the shortest period of time.  It is obvious that 
the formula is flawed. 
<br><br>
WW's advice is, be prepared to be patient.  This is not the place to go if you 
are looking for a quick bite. 
<br><br>
The centerpiece of the restaurant is the open kitchen, where a head chef and 
2 assistants seem to be in perpetual motion.  The menus are hung on the walls 
above the kitchen.  [If you go online you can print out a menu in advance sans the daily specials.  The daily specials are written on two small whiteboards, one that 
shows through the window so you can see it from outside, and the other over the 
chef's head.] 
<br><br>
On average, the restaurant serves 290 people a day, which means each chair 
turns over 6 times a day. 
<br><br>
Once you order and are assigned a table, your meal is served to you by one 
of 4 serving people.  I could not quite figure out the system they used to know 
where meals were to go as they came off the cooking line.  I forgot to ask, but 
whatever the system it seemed to be unerring. 
<br><br>
For some reason, Stanley has gone healthy in his eating habits.  You'll recall 
that at <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2008/09/restaurant_roccos_cafe.shtml">Rocco's</a> he ordered cantaloupe, bananas and cottage cheese.  At Mama's he 
ordered bananas, blue berries and plain yogurt. 
<br><br>
Happily, Jay did not succumb to Stanley's new habits, and ordered the 
Smoked salmon scramble with green onions, bagel and cream cheese, and an 
orange juice. 
<br><br>
Throwing care to the wind for a second time, I ordered the French Toast 
Sampler plate with 3 kinds of french toast - cranberry orange walnut, banana nut, and Swedish cinnamon topped with bananas and mixed berries and a side of 
bacon.  All of it was excellent. 
<br><br>
There is a full menu of breakfast treats, including such weekend specials as 
Dungeness Crab Omelette with Avocado and Sour Cream or a Shrimp and 
Avocado Benedict with Grilled tomatoes. 
<br><br>
There is also a more limited luncheon menu, ranging from a traditional 
hamburger to a California sandwich described as Avocado, Tomato, Red Onion, 
and Jack Cheese on whole grain bread with salad. 
<br><br>
I did not check out the restrooms.  It seemed like too much work to get 
through the crowd to get to the back of the restaurant, where I assume they were 
located.

<a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com">www.slanteddoor.com</a></div>This 175 seat restaurant describes itself as Vietnamese, but is probably 
better described as Pan Asian. 
<br><br>
There were 5 of us at lunch, Jay, Rita, Simma, Ron and me.  We shared 6 
dishes, several of the dishes in multiple servings: chilled Galapagos shrimp; crispy 
imperial rolls with shrimp, pork, glass noodles and peanuts; barbecued Niman 
Ranch pork spareribs with honey Hoisin sauce; grapefruit and jicama salad with 
red cabbage, pickled carrots and candied pecans; Niman Ranch shaking beef 
cubed filet mignon, Sausalie Springs watercress, red onions and lime dipping 
sauce; and chicken claypot with caramel sauce, chilies and fresh ginger.  Jay alone 
also enjoyed a shrimp and pork wonton soup with five sliced pork and egg 
noodles. 
<br><br>
All in all, a relatively light (except for the ribs), but filling meal. 
<br><br>
Again we passed on dessert, although I was particularly drawn to a couple 
of the offerings: Chocolate pudding cake with caramel sauce and whipped creme 
fraiche, and Cardamon rice pudding with wilted muscat and summer royal grapes. 
<br><br>
If you are a lemonade fan, do not pass up the freshly made lemonade.  It is 
served from a carafe that is left at the table. 
<br><br>
If at all possible try for one of the booths that overlook the harbor.  The 
floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlook the Golden Gate Bridge, the ferry 
landings, and on a nice day a skyline filled with sails. 
<br><br>
The restroom is unisex to the extreme.  On one side is a long sink and mirror 
to be used by women and men alike, and on the other side of the room a series of 
individual, fully-enclosed rooms, each with a single white ceramic commode. 
<br><br>
While you are at it, take a stroll through the rest of the peer.  There are a 
variety of interesting shops vending fresh and prepared foods and other related 
products.  On Saturdays, there is an outdoor farmers' market of excellent 
composition.

<a href="http://www.roccoscafe.com">www.roccoscafe.com</a></div>This is a neighborhood joint that Stanley selected for my first breakfast in 
San Francisco. The place looks like it has been there for decades, but at least this 
location opened in 1990. 
<br><br>
Breakfast, lunch and dinner is served.  The menu is endless.  There are 11 
different omelettes, 5 kinds of fritiatas, and about 8 additional egg combinations, 
in addition to the omelettes.  And then of course, there are a half dozen kinds of 
pancakes, waffles, and French toast, and the usual list of meats. 
<br><br>
While WW is not going to layout the entire lunch and dinner menus, there 
are 19 kinds of pasta, along with 12 sandwiches, plus a flock of other entrees on 
the luncheon menu.  And, yes, they do have take-out and offer delivery. 
<br><br>
When we arrived at about 7:45 a.m. there was ample parking on the street. 
The small supermarket that is located next door to Rocco's had opened the large 
metal gate that covered its front door. 
<br><br>
It seats about 50-60 people with small 2 person tables that can obviously be 
configured for whatever size group comes through the door. 
<br><br>
As you enter, you see to the left a large L-shaped counter and the open 
kitchen that seems to fill the back quarter of the restaurant.  The walls are covered 
with framed pictures of everything from movie stars to you name it. 
<br><br>
Stanley chose a half cantaloupe (very large) with bananas and cottage 
cheese.  I selected the Denver omelette, made with egg whites.  The omelette was 
excellent, but the size could easily feed two people.  I did not finish it.  I also had 
cottage cheese and tomatoes on the side, rather than toast and potatos. 
<br><br>
I also had an excellent hot chocolate.  Stanley stuck with coffee, and when 
he noted that it was not very hot, the serving person apologized and made a fresh 
pot. 
<br><br>
There is a unisex restroom.  It fits the rest of the restaurant.  There is a 
reddish door that has the word "Restroom" on a plaque in the middle.  Another 
sign says "This is not an exit."  I entered.  The entire restroom is not larger than 4 
feet wide and 6 feet long.  Immediately to the left is a single white ceramic 
commode.  Directly ahead is a small white ceramic wash basin.  Directly to the 
right there is a wooden door that is slightly ajar.  I glanced through the door and 
saw a narrow set of stairs heading into the basement. The floor is covered with 
mid-sized black tiles, and the walls are covered with multi- colored tiles in shapes 
that are not quite squares and not quite triangles.  The restroom is not as dingy as 
some we have seen, I would still put it in the group.

<h1>Curbside Cafe</h1>
2417 California Street <br>
San Francisco, California <br>
[Don't bother thinking about making a reservation] <br>
Open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday - Sunday. <br>
</div>I went to Curbside with Bill and Suzie.  It is quite small.   Inside there is 
room for 24 people at tables for two that can been brought together for larger 
groups.  There are also two tables out on the sidewalk that seat 2 and 3 people 
respectively.  There is one bench that seats 2 people and the wooden chairs are not 
such that you would want to spend the afternoon on them. 
<br><br>
There was one serving person who handled all of the action from greeting 
folks to taking orders and delivering up the food.   He was in perpetual motion. 
However, when he was attending to a given customer he was attentive and 
unhurried. 
<br><br>
Folks who appeared to be regulars simply came in and sat down at open 
tables without waiting to be seated. 
<br><br>
At noon we were presented with menus that offered breakfast and lunch. 
Suzie had a vegetable salad topped with a chicken breast.  Bill had an omelette 
with cottage cheese and tomato, rather than toast and potatos.  I started with an 
excellent onion soup (lots of onions) and then had a grilled chicken sandwich with 
vegetables on a panini bread. 
<br><br>
Among the offerings, 7 sandwiches, 5 salad combos, 7 salads, 3 entrees, 8 
omelettes.  One example of the entrees is scallops and shrimp on angel hair pasta. 
<br><br>
The restroom is "modest."  The doors say "Restroom" with male and female 
symbols.  Walking in, you are in a room that is approximately 4 feet by 4 ft.  It has 
a white ceramic commode and a tiny white ceramic wash basin set into a corner 
next to the commode.  The refuse container between the commode and the 
washbasin overflowed with used brown paper towels.  There is a dark floor of 
some composition and dark tiles up to about waist height.  These are topped by 
one row of medium-sized, bright red tiles.  The rest of the walls and ceiling are 
painted in a dark color.

<h1>In-N-Out Burger</h1>
San Francisco, California <br></div>Simma, Ron, Rita, Jay and I decided to try, on Stan's recommendation, an 
In-N-Out Burger.  To hear Stan tell it, it is "the burger."  And, if you don't order it 
in a certain way, you make it very clear to everyone that you are not "In-N-Out 
Burger sophisticated." 
<br><br>
In-N-Out Burger shops are found in California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. 
We were in San Francisco, so we decided to try one in that area. 
<br><br>
To experience the In-N-Out Burger you must follow Stanley's instructions. 
<br><br>
1st - you hire a Lincoln Navigator with a driver 
<br><br>
2nd - you explain to the Four Seasons hotel doorman and the driver why 
you have decided to go to the Daly City outlet in Mateo, which is 30 minutes from 
the hotel, rather than the Ferry Pier mall that is 9 blocks from the hotel or the shop 
that is on Jefferson Street that is about 10 minutes from the hotel and also close to 
Stanley's house. 
<br><br>
The reason for the selection of this particular In-N-Out Burger is of course 
quite simple.  It is because Stanley thinks that the In-N-Out Burger shop outside 
the city has the better burgers than the ones closer to us.  This is not withstanding 
the fact that the meat, cheese, bread, potatos, and condiments in all of these stores 
come from the same suppliers, and the cooking instructions and training are 
identical.  [If, at the this point, you have a question as to who is crazier, Stanley or 
the 5 of us, it may be a close call.] 
<br><br>
Eating at In-N-Out burger is not complicated. There are 3 options. <br>
<ol>
<li> A double cheese, double burger on a bun 
<li> A single cheese, single burger on a bun 
<li> A single burger on a bun 
</ol>

The actual burger and bun are medium-sized, larger than a White Castle, but 
smaller than a McDonalds.  Each burger comes with lettuce tomato, onions, and 
sauce, all optional. 
<br><br>
Each also comes with French fries, unless you request otherwise.  Much is 
made of the preparation of the French fries.   Each store starts the day with a fresh 
batch of whole potatoes that are washed, peeled and hand-cut, one potato at a time. 
They are cooked in 100%, trans-fat free, cholesterol-free, vegetable oil. 
<br><br>
I did not record what each person in our party ordered, but each of them 
ordered a single item.  I decided to do a taste testing, and ordered a double/double 
and a single/single.  It is my judgement that the single/single is better than the 
double/double.  Because of the greater amount of cheese in the larger version, the 
whole thing becomes soggy more quickly than the single/single.  I did manage to 
finish both and a few fries to boot. 
<br><br>
The general conclusion of everyone in the party was that we have eaten 
better, if different burgers.  However, there was some feeling that they were not as 
good as McDonalds. 
<br><br>
The restroom was clean, but nothing to write about. 
<br><br>
On the way back to the hotel I asked our driver whether he had a view about 
the In-N-Out burgers.  In his view, the burgers at Taylors, another hamburger 
haven, are superior. and it is also located only 9 blocks from our hotel.

<h1>Acquerello</h1>
1722 Sacramento Street <br>
San Francisco, California 94109 <br>
415-567-5432 <br>
<a href="http://www.acquerello.com">www.acquerello.com</a>
</div>As will soon become apparent, your editor recently spent time in San 
Francisco for the occasion of Katie Neisen and Mark Jordan's wedding. 
<br><br>
I was able to sample three breakfast/lunch joints, a restaurant at the Ferry 
Building, an In-N-Out Burger, and a first-rate, high-end restaurant. 
<br><br>
As always, dinner with Julia and Stan is a treat!  Stanley always selects 
interesting restaurants for our dinners.  Julia is always an interesting dinner 
partner. 
<br><br>
Acquerello's well-appointed dining room seats up to 55 people for regular 
dining, in tables of two and four that can be combined for parties of various sizes. 
For special events, the dining room can seat as many as 75 people; however, it 
becomes pretty crowded. 
<br><br>
The service was exceptional.  There appear to be 3 captains working the 
floor, including the owner and his son, as well as a serving person.  It occurred to 
me that the service might have been a function of the fact that the owner knows 
Stanley (as it seems everyone does in the San Francisco food world).  However, all 
of the other diners appeared to be getting roughly the same attention. 
<br><br>
At the onset we were served a Fresh Brodo of vegetables with peas and 
beans. 
<br><br>
Julia is a vegetarian and, since she was not finding an entree on the menu 
that was exactly to her liking, she was offered a special vegetable entre consisting 
of several prepared vegetables which followed her selected first course, Delicate 
Parmesan Baudino topped with lemony zucchini salad. 
<br><br>
Stan started with Roast Peppers stuffed with tuna-Piedmontese style, 
followed by a Risotto of sweet prawns with Prosecco and English peas, and 
concluded with Baked halibut over regula with shellfish, peas and saffron 
vinaigrette. 
<br><br>
I could not resist starting with Chilled Sonoma lamb tongue with pickled 
baby carrots and salsa verde.  The taste is more subdued than my all-time favorite 
of pickled beef tongue.  As a second course I chose Lemon-ricotta gnocchi with 
spinach and zucchini sauce, and finished with Pan-sauteed black bass over duo of 
lentils with shaved artichoke salad. 
<br><br>
None of us were in the mood to be tempted by one of the tasty desserts, 
except for a few delightful cookies. 
<br><br>
Stan and Julia tried a number of wines.  The first selection that was 
presented to Julia did not meet her taste, so a second bottle of a different taste was 
quickly provided. 
<br><br>
Commensurate with the high level of service we experienced generally, 
when I asked for directions to the men's room, our serving person led me to a 
floor-to-ceiling curtain.  She parted the curtain and pointed in a direction that 
turned out to be the men's room. 
<br><br>
The men's room is very commodious.  The floor is covered with large tan 
tiles.  Large grey tiles cover the walls to about the 3-foot level, topped by a strip of 
1/2 size large tan tiles.  The balance of the walls and ceiling are painted in a dark 
brown color. 
<br><br>
In addition to very serviceable white ceramic commode and washbasin, 
there is one amenity now found in most men's rooms. Next to the door and across 
from the commode and washbasin there is a square glass top table with flowers 
and a burning candle.  On each of two sides of the table there is an antique- 
appearing wooden chair with a floor seat cushion. 
<br><br>
Reservations are clearly required.

</div>This interesting little restaurant was suggested by Lisa, with whom I had a delightful lunch. 
<br><br>
On the day we were there the weather was totally suitable for eating outside. 
The way this restaurant is constructed is the front wall consists of two very large overhead sliding garage doors. When the weather is appropriate, as it was that day, 
the front and the side of the restaurant were fully open. 
<br><br>
The menu changes every day.  On the day we were there for lunch the menu 
included a mix of items that made it possible to select items that are more 
traditionally eaten at breakfast, like eggs or pancakes, or lunch, like salads and 
pastas. 
<br><br>
Lisa selected the insalata Manzo - seared hanger steak, arugula, frisee, 
shallot & pecorino.  I opted for gnocchi con granturco - crisp potato dumplings, 
corn, scallions & Pecorino Romano.  Lisa had sorbet and I had ice cream to finish 
off the meal.  Based on those meals we both felt we would opt to eat there again. 
<br><br>
There appeared to be about 40 seats available.  The service was quite good.

The problem in being taken by a good friend to dinner at his favorite 
restaurant, where he introduces you proudly to the owner, is that you can't ask for  ketchup. 
<br><br>
While waiting for the car in front of me to drive on, after standing for an 
endless amount of time at a stop sign, and having decided he was waiting for it  to 
say "GO," and being in Sun Valley, Idaho, where no one ever blows a horn or 
displays impatience, I realized the motto for such a town should be, "If you're not 
bleeding and you're in a hurry, you're in the wrong town." 
<br><br>
Got up this morning; the TV didn't work; called the Cable Company and got 
disconnected; tried later on my cell phone in the car, no reception and the car 
needs brakes; realized the only machine that did its job today and everyday was 
the spoon. 
<br><br>
Also resolved not to buy anything that has to be opened with teeth, from 
cheese to CDs. <br><br>

The public remains unhappy with the performance of the Democratic- 
controlled House and Senate. 
<br><br>
In at least 4 national surveys taken 8/12-31 the average disapproval of 
Congress was 74%.  18% approved its work. 

<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 49 </li>
  <li> Republicans 49 </li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem) </li>
</ul>
<br>

While Democrats continue to show substantial progress toward increasing 
their majority, the prospects for reaching the magic number of 60 does not seem to 
be great. 
<br><br>
Among the Toss-Up States, the Democratic candidates lead in Colorado and 
New Hampshire.  Republican incumbents are leading in Minnesota, Oregon and 
Mississippi. 
<br><br>
New Mexico and Alaska are two currently Republican- controlled seats in 
which Democrats are now leading.  In Alaska, Ted Stevens (R) trails Mark Begich 
(D), and in New Mexico, which is an open seat, Tom Udall (D) has a solid lead. 
<br><br>
Despite his legal problems, Ted Stevens survived his primary with ease, and 
ostensibly he will come to trial in D.C. Federal Court in sufficient time to have the 
matter resolved, at least at the trial level, before the election. 
<br><br>
Minnesota, which last month moved from Toss-Up to Lean Republican, 
moves back to Toss-Up. 
<br><br>
In New Hampshire, Jean Shaheen (D) seems to be doing a little better in her 
race to unseat incumbent Republican John Sununu. 
<br><br>
Mary Landrieu (D), the incumbent in Louisiana, who has been on 
everyone's watch list for the entire cycle, is holding her own and likely to be re- 
elected. 


<br>

Looking at the races today, it is not hard to see the Democratic caucus at 55 
seats, including 1 Independent, Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

<br><br>
<b>Act I - Post-"nomination" to the conventions </b>
<br><br>
The pre-convention period was relatively quiet for both Party's candidates. 
There was some drama between the Obama campaign and Senator Clinton and 
President Clinton.  It is hard to understand why the Obama campaign didn't give 
them their convention program positions within a week or 10 days after she 
publicly withdrew from the race.  Their failure to do so kept tensions alive for a 
longer period than necessary. 
<br><br>
Obama made it clear that he did not intend to take Federal public financing 
($84,000,000) in the general election.  McCain has taken the funding. 
<br><br>

The Obama campaign has taken over the Democratic National Committee 
and moved many of its historical general election functions to Chicago.  McCain 
on the other hand has installed some trusted lieutenants at the Republican National 
Committee. 
<br><br>
<b>Act II - The Conventions 8/25-9/4/08</b>
<br><br>
Both Parties delivered well-organized public spectacles, with the 
Republicans to be given particular credit for having pulled themselves together 
after losing most of the first day of their convention. 
<br><br>
Each of the two conventions drew TV/Cable audiences that were the largest 
since 1992.  Over the 3-day period, in which both conventions had prime time 
hour activity, the Republican convention drew the larger audience. 
<br><br>
Comparing the 3 nights when both conventions were in session, Tuesday- 
Thursday, The Republicans won the ratings contest on Wednesday (Palin) and 
Thursday (McCain) and the Democrats won when Hillary Clinton was the featured 
speaker in the prime time hour - 10:00-11:00 EST. 
<br><br>
The individual ratings for each of the principals + Clinton was as follows: 
[each point of ratings equals 1,150,000 households]

The Democratic and Republican Vice Presidential running mates are quite 
different. 
Barack Obama's pick, Senator Joe Biden (D-Del), is a long-time 
Washington player, who is just finishing his 6th term in the Senate. 
<br><br>
John McCain managed to surprise most of the political world with his 
selection of Governor Sarah Palin (R-Alaska), who has been Governor of Alaska 
just under 2 years.  Prior to that time, she was Mayor of a town of less than 10,000 
people.  McCain decided to try and hit the long ball, and he seems to have done so. 
<br><br>
What does each of them bring to the "party?" 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
The obvious is that Biden adds an important foreign policy credential to the 
Democratic team. 
<br><br>
But there is something that Biden brings that is not so obvious, his 
knowledge and his relationships. 
<br><br>
He brings on-the-spot knowledge of Senator John McCain and his 
legislative record in practice, enabling Biden to engage McCain in ways and with 
authority that others cannot. 
<br><br>
He also brings knowledge of the Congress, its players and its ways.  Even 
though Democrats are likely to increase their majority in the next Senate, this will 
be the place where Obama will have the most difficulty passing his programs.  A 
well-connected Vice President, especially as respected as Biden, is effectively the 
Administration's best lobbyist in the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
<br><br>
Biden's knowledge of the government as a whole is imperative to the 
"change" Obama plans to implement as President.  In essence, to change a system 
you have to know how it works, which Biden does. 
<br><br>

In the area of foreign policy, his knowledge of the players on the 
international stage and the history of dangerous hot spots around the world, will be 
invaluable to Obama as he governs. 
<br><br>
In a related area, Israel is not Obama's strongest suit. Israel has no better 
friend in the U.S. Congress than Biden, and that is something that can be used in 
the Jewish community. 
<br><br>
While Biden will be an effective advocate on the campaign trail, in 
particular in  working class communities, his most important role will come if 
Obama is elected. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

Palin's most obvious contribution is coming in the here and now.  It is clear 
that she has resolved whatever hesitancy the Christian right had about the McCain 
candidacy.  While McCain said the right things, they were not sure about him. 
Now they know they will have an unquestioned advocate just down the hall from 
the Oval office.  She appears to live the values about which this community is so 
concerned. 
<br><br>
There is no questioning the excitement that she has infused into the McCain 
campaign.  She has captured the imagination of the public.  The crowds that 
McCain has drawn since the convention, in his joint appearances with Palin, far 
exceed anything he drew solo. 
<br><br>
Palin is a strong woman to whom many women relate because they admire 
the role that she has played in raising a large family and serving as a major public 
official. 
<br><br>
The early evidence is that she has given McCain a new lease on life among 
white women.  The ABC/WP survey found a 20-point swing among this group 
after the Republican convention.  While eyebrows were raised at the size of the 
swing, the NBC/WSJ survey found a 10-point swing.  Something is obviously 
going on. 
<br><br>
If anything, Palin's addition to the ticket has assured that the McCain 
campaign has dominated the media coverage since her selection. 
Palin should not be underestimated.  Anyone who can be presented to the 
stage of a national political convention for the first time, in a major prime time 
role, and deliver the performance that she delivered, has strengths that may not be 
apparent or expected. 
<br><br>
Palin's strongest attraction is that she is authentic.  And John McCain knows 
what he has when he says "I can't wait to introduce Palin to Washington."
<br><br>
Palin will undoubtedly spend some of her time with McCain, helping to 
drum up his crowds.  But don't be surprised if a new bus shows up called "Straight 
Talk Express #2" in which Palin will campaign back and forth through 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Missouri. 
 <br><br>
Her contribution to the operation of the Administration, if McCain is 
elected, will play out after January 20th. 

<br>
<br>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

70% to 47% Americans see Biden as being more prepared for the job of 
Vice President than Palin.  However, 60% to 40% see Palin as someone to whom 
they can relate. 
<br><br>
Following the Republican convention, 44% rate Palin favorably as opposed 
to 22% who had that view before the convention.  No surprise that Biden's 
favorability at 37% did not change during the same time period. 
<br><br>
39% of McCain voters say the Vice Presidential choice  influences their 
support of him.  24% say this about Obama.

<b>Who's the Better Leader?</b>
<br><br>

With the selection of Sarah Palin, the Republican Governor of Alaska, as 
the Vice Presidential nominee of the Republican Party, the debate is once again 
joined.  Between women and men, who makes the better leader? 
<br><br>
69% of Americans believe that men and women make equally good leaders. 
21% say men are superior and 6% give that recognition to women. 
<br><br>
When asked why there are not more women in public office, 51% of 
respondents say it is because Americans simply are not ready to elect women to 
high office; 43% say that women who are active in politics are held back by men; 
38% say women are discriminated against in all realms of society, and politics is 
no exception. 
<br><br>
Women make up 17% of the members of the U.S. House, 16% of U.S. 
Senators, 18% of Governors and 24% of State legislators.  The United States ranks 
85th in the world in the share of women in its national legislative body. 
<br><br>
Below are a series of characteristics and judgements concerning what is 
most true of men or women.

<b>Act III - Post-conventions to the 1st Debate </b>
<br><br>
The response to the polls after the conventions by the political chattering 
class has been deafening.  Obama supporters are hanging crepe and explaining 
endlessly what Obama has to do immediately if he is to be elected.  McCain's 
backers are showing a level of excitement that would suggest they think the race is 
all but over and McCain is preparing to move into the White House. 
<br><br>
Both groups need to get a grip.  Bottom line, this campaign still has a long 
way to go.

With the caveat that polls around conventions are notoriously unpredictive, 
here is a look at the data before and after the conventions.

Bottom line - the race was within the margin of error before the conventions 
and that is where it is today. 
<br><br>
To remind, after the Democratic convention in 2004, John Kerry was 9 
points behind George Bush immediately after the Republican convention which 
ended on September 2nd, that year.

Most recently John McCain has improved the margin of his  relatively 
consistent lead over Obama on the statement - "Is a strong and decisive leader." 
For the last couple of months McCain has had an average lead of about 6 points. 
Now that has widened to 11 points, 52% - 41%.  Following his convention Obama 
actually showed a 2-point lead over McCain on this score, but that has disappeared 
and then some.  [Gallop 9/08]

In a recent Washington Post/ABC survey (9/08) respondents were asked 3 
questions. 
<br><br>
A review of those questions leaves the following general impressions. 
On the question of handling taxes, the economy and the Federal budget 
deficit, the two candidates are treated equally. 
<br><br>
But on the question of how well either of them understands the economic 
problems people in this country are having, Obama has a clear advantage over 
McCain.

taxes will go up if he is elected.  About 1/3 of folks think that is the case with 
McCain.  However, while 1/3 think their taxes will go down under Obama, only 
9% think that about McCain.

On the question of whether Hillary Clinton voters are returning to the fold

NBC/WSJ survey found that 60% of former Clinton supporters are now 
supporting Obama, a jump of 8 points since August.
