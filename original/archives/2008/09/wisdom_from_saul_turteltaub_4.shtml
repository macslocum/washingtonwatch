<p></p>
You know the airport is less than thirty minutes from your hotel when you 
arrive in the back seat of your taxi cab and still can't click on the seatbelt. 
<br><br>
The problem in being taken by a good friend to dinner at his favorite 
restaurant, where he introduces you proudly to the owner, is that you can't ask for  ketchup. 
<br><br>
While waiting for the car in front of me to drive on, after standing for an 
endless amount of time at a stop sign, and having decided he was waiting for it  to 
say "GO," and being in Sun Valley, Idaho, where no one ever blows a horn or 
displays impatience, I realized the motto for such a town should be, "If you're not 
bleeding and you're in a hurry, you're in the wrong town." 
<br><br>
Got up this morning; the TV didn't work; called the Cable Company and got 
disconnected; tried later on my cell phone in the car, no reception and the car 
needs brakes; realized the only machine that did its job today and everyday was 
the spoon. 
<br><br>
Also resolved not to buy anything that has to be opened with teeth, from 
cheese to CDs. <br><br>
