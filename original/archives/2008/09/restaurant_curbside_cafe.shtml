<h1>Curbside Cafe</h1>
2417 California Street <br>
San Francisco, California <br>
[Don't bother thinking about making a reservation] <br>
Open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday - Sunday. <br>
</div>I went to Curbside with Bill and Suzie.  It is quite small.   Inside there is 
room for 24 people at tables for two that can been brought together for larger 
groups.  There are also two tables out on the sidewalk that seat 2 and 3 people 
respectively.  There is one bench that seats 2 people and the wooden chairs are not 
such that you would want to spend the afternoon on them. 
<br><br>
There was one serving person who handled all of the action from greeting 
folks to taking orders and delivering up the food.   He was in perpetual motion. 
However, when he was attending to a given customer he was attentive and 
unhurried. 
<br><br>
Folks who appeared to be regulars simply came in and sat down at open 
tables without waiting to be seated. 
<br><br>
At noon we were presented with menus that offered breakfast and lunch. 
Suzie had a vegetable salad topped with a chicken breast.  Bill had an omelette 
with cottage cheese and tomato, rather than toast and potatos.  I started with an 
excellent onion soup (lots of onions) and then had a grilled chicken sandwich with 
vegetables on a panini bread. 
<br><br>
Among the offerings, 7 sandwiches, 5 salad combos, 7 salads, 3 entrees, 8 
omelettes.  One example of the entrees is scallops and shrimp on angel hair pasta. 
<br><br>
The restroom is "modest."  The doors say "Restroom" with male and female 
symbols.  Walking in, you are in a room that is approximately 4 feet by 4 ft.  It has 
a white ceramic commode and a tiny white ceramic wash basin set into a corner 
next to the commode.  The refuse container between the commode and the 
washbasin overflowed with used brown paper towels.  There is a dark floor of 
some composition and dark tiles up to about waist height.  These are topped by 
one row of medium-sized, bright red tiles.  The rest of the walls and ceiling are 
painted in a dark color.
