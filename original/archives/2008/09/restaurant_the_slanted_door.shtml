<h1>The Slanted Door</h1>
 1 Ferry Building #3 <br>
San Francisco, California 94111 <br>
415-861-8032 <br>
Fax 415-861-8329 <br>
<a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com">www.slanteddoor.com</a></div>This 175 seat restaurant describes itself as Vietnamese, but is probably 
better described as Pan Asian. 
<br><br>
There were 5 of us at lunch, Jay, Rita, Simma, Ron and me.  We shared 6 
dishes, several of the dishes in multiple servings: chilled Galapagos shrimp; crispy 
imperial rolls with shrimp, pork, glass noodles and peanuts; barbecued Niman 
Ranch pork spareribs with honey Hoisin sauce; grapefruit and jicama salad with 
red cabbage, pickled carrots and candied pecans; Niman Ranch shaking beef 
cubed filet mignon, Sausalie Springs watercress, red onions and lime dipping 
sauce; and chicken claypot with caramel sauce, chilies and fresh ginger.  Jay alone 
also enjoyed a shrimp and pork wonton soup with five sliced pork and egg 
noodles. 
<br><br>
All in all, a relatively light (except for the ribs), but filling meal. 
<br><br>
Again we passed on dessert, although I was particularly drawn to a couple 
of the offerings: Chocolate pudding cake with caramel sauce and whipped creme 
fraiche, and Cardamon rice pudding with wilted muscat and summer royal grapes. 
<br><br>
If you are a lemonade fan, do not pass up the freshly made lemonade.  It is 
served from a carafe that is left at the table. 
<br><br>
If at all possible try for one of the booths that overlook the harbor.  The 
floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlook the Golden Gate Bridge, the ferry 
landings, and on a nice day a skyline filled with sails. 
<br><br>
The restroom is unisex to the extreme.  On one side is a long sink and mirror 
to be used by women and men alike, and on the other side of the room a series of 
individual, fully-enclosed rooms, each with a single white ceramic commode. 
<br><br>
While you are at it, take a stroll through the rest of the peer.  There are a 
variety of interesting shops vending fresh and prepared foods and other related 
products.  On Saturdays, there is an outdoor farmers' market of excellent 
composition.
