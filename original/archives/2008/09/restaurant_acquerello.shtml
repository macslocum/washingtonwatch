</div>As will soon become apparent, your editor recently spent time in San 
Francisco for the occasion of Katie Neisen and Mark Jordan's wedding. 
<br><br>
I was able to sample three breakfast/lunch joints, a restaurant at the Ferry 
Building, an In-N-Out Burger, and a first-rate, high-end restaurant. 
<br><br>
As always, dinner with Julia and Stan is a treat!  Stanley always selects 
interesting restaurants for our dinners.  Julia is always an interesting dinner 
partner. 
<br><br>
Acquerello's well-appointed dining room seats up to 55 people for regular 
dining, in tables of two and four that can be combined for parties of various sizes. 
For special events, the dining room can seat as many as 75 people; however, it 
becomes pretty crowded. 
<br><br>
The service was exceptional.  There appear to be 3 captains working the 
floor, including the owner and his son, as well as a serving person.  It occurred to 
me that the service might have been a function of the fact that the owner knows 
Stanley (as it seems everyone does in the San Francisco food world).  However, all 
of the other diners appeared to be getting roughly the same attention. 
<br><br>
At the onset we were served a Fresh Brodo of vegetables with peas and 
beans. 
<br><br>
Julia is a vegetarian and, since she was not finding an entree on the menu 
that was exactly to her liking, she was offered a special vegetable entre consisting 
of several prepared vegetables which followed her selected first course, Delicate 
Parmesan Baudino topped with lemony zucchini salad. 
<br><br>
Stan started with Roast Peppers stuffed with tuna-Piedmontese style, 
followed by a Risotto of sweet prawns with Prosecco and English peas, and 
concluded with Baked halibut over regula with shellfish, peas and saffron 
vinaigrette. 
<br><br>
I could not resist starting with Chilled Sonoma lamb tongue with pickled 
baby carrots and salsa verde.  The taste is more subdued than my all-time favorite 
of pickled beef tongue.  As a second course I chose Lemon-ricotta gnocchi with 
spinach and zucchini sauce, and finished with Pan-sauteed black bass over duo of 
lentils with shaved artichoke salad. 
<br><br>
None of us were in the mood to be tempted by one of the tasty desserts, 
except for a few delightful cookies. 
<br><br>
Stan and Julia tried a number of wines.  The first selection that was 
presented to Julia did not meet her taste, so a second bottle of a different taste was 
quickly provided. 
<br><br>
Commensurate with the high level of service we experienced generally, 
when I asked for directions to the men's room, our serving person led me to a 
floor-to-ceiling curtain.  She parted the curtain and pointed in a direction that 
turned out to be the men's room. 
<br><br>
The men's room is very commodious.  The floor is covered with large tan 
tiles.  Large grey tiles cover the walls to about the 3-foot level, topped by a strip of 
1/2 size large tan tiles.  The balance of the walls and ceiling are painted in a dark 
brown color. 
<br><br>
In addition to very serviceable white ceramic commode and washbasin, 
there is one amenity now found in most men's rooms. Next to the door and across 
from the commode and washbasin there is a square glass top table with flowers 
and a burning candle.  On each of two sides of the table there is an antique- 
appearing wooden chair with a floor seat cushion. 
<br><br>
Reservations are clearly required.
