<p></p>
There is little left to be said about President Bush.  In addition to the disapproval of the overall job he is doing:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 73% disapprove of the job being done by President Bush on the economy (highest disapproval of his tenure).  [NBC/WSJ 4/08] 

<li> 64% disapprove of Bush's handling of Iraq. [CBS/NYT 4/08] 

<li> 56% have negative feelings about the President (ties for most negative feelings of his ensure). [NBC/WSJ 4/08] 
</ul>
<br>
It is hard to see how public attitudes toward the President will change between now and end of his term in January 2009.
