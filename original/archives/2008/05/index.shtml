</div>Cousin Jesse was ordained as a Rabbi on May 4th in New York City.  His post-ordination party for family and friends was at Noah's Ark. 
<br><br>
It seats between 80 and 100 people, and, as expected, the tables are close enough so you can participate in the 
conversations of complete strangers. The menu for the luncheon included the following: 
<br><br>
Cup of Chicken Noodle Soup <br>
Corned Beef, Pastrami or Turkey Sandwich <br>
Grilled Veggie Wrap <br>
Large Tossed Salad, Cole Slaw, French Fries, Pickles <br>
Chocolate Chip Cookies, Rugelach, Chocolate Torah Cake 
<br><br>
This is the kind of old style deli in which you start gaining weight when you walk through the door.  Consider some of these offerings on the never-ending menu. 
<br><br>
Pastrami Burger Deluxe - a full 1/2 pound of meat topped with Strips of Grilled Pastrami on a bun, accompanied by steak fries.  You can also get the Pastrami topping on a large frankfurter in a bun. 
<br><br>
Eggs, fried or scrambled, with mixed delicatessen. 
<br><br>
Rueben Wrap - Corned beef, Sauerkraut, & Russian dressing, rolled in a Flour Tortilla. 
<br><br>
Noah's Three Sons - Corned beef, Pastrami & Turkey with 3 slices of bread.  (If you want your meat extra lean, this $18 sandwich costs an extra $1.00.) 
<br><br>
The deli specializes in catering.  Here is an offering called a "Mid-Life Crisis Party."  Serves 40-45 people. 
<br><br>
4 doz Franks in Jackets, 4 doz Mini Potato Knishes, <br>
4 doz Mini Egg rolls, 20 pounds of carved turkey <br>
10 pounds of cold meat platters, 9 pounds each of potato salad and cole slaw, 9 pounds of Rye bread 
<br><br>
The service was deli traditional. Friendly and uncomplicated. 
<br><br>
There are two unisex restrooms.  They are a decent size as restrooms go.  There is a white ceramic commode and sink. Conveniently located next to the commode is a plunger with a traditional black rubber head and wooden handle.
<br><br>
The floor is covered in small blue tiles with a pattern strip of white tiles around the edge.  There are yellow tiles on the walls to about 3 feet, with a border at that height, and off-white tiles covering the rest of the walls. 
Oh yes, there is a fold-down baby changing table. 
<br><br>
It was a special treat to see members of our family (my mother's side), some of whom I had not seen for decades.

<h1>Park Avenue Spring</h1>
63rd & Park Avenue <br>
New York, NY 10021 <br>
212-844-1900 <br>
<a href="http://www.parkavenyc.com/">www.parkavenyc.com</a>
</div>This restaurant is known for changing its menu with the 
seasons.  When I was there with Rita, Jay and Meredith, the 
Spring menu was being featured. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is entered on 63rd.  You walk in to a 
relatively small area that includes a maitre de's station, a small bar with 6 high stools, and waiting diners crowded together. 
<br><br>
To the left, up a few stairs, there is a hallway about 20 
feet long.  On the left is a long, high table with high chairs, 
which can be used for dinner seating.  To the right are the two 
restrooms. 
<br><br>
Up 4 more stairs, at the end of the hall, is one of the two 
dining rooms.  The second dining room is to the right as you 
enter.  Together the two rooms can accommodate around 200 people. 
<br><br>
We were given a table in the main level dining room.  Both 
dining rooms are fairly dark, crowded and noisy.  The tables and 
chairs are uncovered wood and not the most comfortable. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, the food is quite good, and the service 
was spot on.  There were an unusual number of floor managers 
making sure everything flowed smoothly. 
<br><br>
The menu is marked by innovative dishes for each course. 
<br><br>
Rita started with Thai "Minestrone", Spring Vegetables, 
Lemongrass Tapioca; Jay went with Proscuitto and Quail Egg; 
<br><br>
Meredith had a Cured-Lemon Caesar Salad; and I opened with a 
Sweet Pea & Carrot Salad and Crispy Soft Shell Crab. 
Meredith selected as her main course Filet Mignon with Roast 
Beet and Gorgonzola Tart; Rita opted for Grilled Lamb Chops with 
Apricots, Toasted Cumin, Mint Garden salad.  Jay had the Dover 
Sole with Fines Herbes Brown Butter; and I ordered the Roast 
Spring Chicken with Honey Lemon Provencal Vegetables. 
<br><br>
In addition to the main dishes there are a series of 
offerings "For The Table."  We selected Asparagus with Melted 
Fontina; Potato Latkes, which were small, crispy and delicious; 
and Whipped Sweet Peas.  It might be interesting to make an 
entire meal of these "For The Table" items. 
<br><br>
The restroom is very small, with a dark, large tile floor. The walls are covered with cream-colored, domino-shaped tiles that are laid end-to-end from floor to ceiling. 
<br><br>
The entry area has a wall-hanging urinal to the left, with a 
wall-hanging divider separating it from the open doorway.  There 
is a relatively small, dark grey counter, with a small, white, 
square ceramic washbasin in the middle.  There is a door that 
presumably leads to a separate commode room, but it was not 
available on the two trips I made to the restroom.

64% of Americans would not forgive their spouse for an extramarital affair. 
<br><br>
In married couples in America today, 68% say the wife does the laundry, while 57% say the husband does the yard work.  This division of labor has not changed in the last 11 years.

51% believe that government should redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich.

On the other hand, the last time Americans rated the 
Congress as low as it is currently rated (68% disapproval) was in 
the 1996 period. 
<br><br>
The 18% approval rating of Congress found by Gallup in early 
May ties the lowest rating recorded in the 34-year history of the 
poll.  The previous lows were found in August 2007 and March 
1992.

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

<ul>
<li> Democrats   49 
<li> Republicans  49 
<li> Independents  2 (caucus Dem) 
</ul>
<br>
There have been no changes in Senate races which suggest 
that Republican prospects have improved.  If anything, it is 
leaning the other way. 
<br><br>
Virginia now seems like an almost certain Democratic pickup, 
with former governor Mark Warner exercising control in the race.
<br><br>
Colorado remains a likely Democratic pickup, along with New 
Hampshire, now that Jeanne Shaheen (D) has decided to run.  Mary 
Landrieu (D) from Louisiana remains the most potentially 
vulnerable Democratic incumbent. 
<br><br>
Tim Johnson (D) of South Dakota seems to be on the road to 
re-election. 
<br><br>
Incumbent Ted Stevens (R) Alaska is in trouble.  Mark Begich 
(D), the Mayor of Anchorage, is challenging him.  Given Stevens' 
alleged problems, Begich's prospects have improved of late. 
<br><br>
In Minnesota, incumbent Norm Coleman (R) is being challenged 
by Al Franken (D).  While Franken's prospects of beating Coleman 
seemed to be improving, recent events may turn out to be a gift 
to Coleman.  It appears that Franken failed to pay certain taxes 
in several states relating to a business in which he was 
involved. 
<br><br>
Mark Udall's (D) prospects in Colorado seem to be improving.

It is likely that the Democrats will pick up multiple seats  in the November election.  Turning again to the Cook Political  Report for an assessment of House races, the current lineup is as  follows.

In the April NBC/WSJ poll a generic Democrat has a 13-point advantage over a generic Republican. In the CBS/NYT survey taken in the same time frame the Democratic advantage is 15 points.

                                 Your editor has experienced every Presidential campaign nce 1964.   Each of those campaigns had its own moments, and its own memories.  But there has never been anything quite like the 2008 Presidential campaign. 

<h2>Democratic Primary</h2>
Act VII of the  Democratic Presidential primary campaign has begun. 
<br><br>
During Act I the major candidates, for the most part, played quite nicely together and were basically positive.  
<br><br>
During Act II the gloves came off. 
<br><br>
Act III ended with the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, after which the field narrowed to two. 
<br><br>
Act IV played out on Super Tuesday.  The play was supposed to effectively be over by then, and the Democratic nominee would be known.  It didn't end that way. 
<br><br>
Many thought that Act V would be Hillary Clinton's last stand.  It didn't work out that way, as she won Ohio and the popular vote in Texas. 
<br><br>
Act VI ended on May 6th.  During this act, Clinton won Pennsylvania (Delegates: HRC 85 - BO 73 ).  Barack Obama won North Carolina (HRC 50 - BO 65).  Clinton narrowly won Indiana by 14,500 popular votes (HRC 38 - BO 34).  Adding elected won in the 3 contests Clinton had a net +1. 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Act VII opened on May 7th, and will finish on June 3, give or take a few days.  It includes scenes in West Virginia 5/13, Oregon 5/20, Kentucky 5/20, Puerto Rico 6/1, Montana 6/3, and South Dakota 6/3.  [217 pledged Delegates to be elected.] 
<br><br>
This act has opened with a bang.  On May 13th, Clinton overran Obama by 41 points in West Virginia, a state that every successful Democratic candidate since 1912 has won in the general election. 
<br><br>
Then on May 14th, just about 24 hours after the polls closed in West Virginia, John Edwards stood with Barack Obama on a stage in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and announced that he was supporting Obama over Clinton. 
<br><br>
While he premised his endorsement of Obama with strong and positive statements about Clinton, his support of Obama was unequivocal.  Notably Elizabeth Edwards was not with him. 
<br><br>
The big question now is whether Edwards' support will provide new impetus to Obama in Kentucky on May 20th, a contest that Clinton is currently scheduled to win. 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
There will be an Act VIII.  It will end no later than August 28th.  Some argue that it will be anti-climatic, but they are not thinking about Thursday August 27th. 
<br><br>
On that night, for the first time in the history of this country, a woman or an African American man will accept the nomination of a major political party, the Democratic Party. 
<br>

Delegate and Super Delegate totals are the only official results needed for nomination under Democratic Party rules.  The popular vote is used as part of the persuasion campaign directed at Super Delegates. 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
And then there is Michigan and Florida.  While the 
situations in Michigan and Florida are quite different, the net 
result is the same. 
<br><br>
The delegations from both states will be seated at the 
Democratic National Convention.  However, as a practical matter, 
the Delegate results from neither state will have any impact on 
the outcome of the nomination fight. 
<br><br>
Best estimate is that, if Clinton's position was to prevail 
(that the results from Florida be accepted as is [Clinton and 
Obama were on the ballot] and the uncommitted vote in Michigan be 
treated as if it had been cast for Obama), Clinton would net an 
additional 55 pledged Delegates. 
<br><br>
The Democratic Party's Rules and By-Laws Committee will meet 
on May 31st. The Committee has jurisdiction over the Florida and 
Michigan cases until June 29th. Thereafter, the Convention 
Credentials Committee will have to make the decision. 
<br><br>
Betting is that the matter will be resolved on May 31st.  
Critical to the decision is finding a solution that both 
candidates will endorse or at least not oppose. 
<br><br>
The Obama campaign is not likely to accept any proposal that 
results in Obama having a lead of less than 100 pledged Delegates 
overall.  And it would not surprise if the Clinton campaign 
accepts a result in which the relative results of the two 
primaries are accepted, but each Delegate has less than a full 
vote.
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
It makes little difference at this stage, but it may be 
rth remembering that Obama, Joe Biden, and Bill Richardson 
withdrew from the Michigan primary in October 2007.  They acted 
at the request of the four states who were allowed to conduct 
primaries or caucuses before the Democrats' primary window 
opened. 
<br><br>
Senator Clinton, Chris Dodd, Dennis Kucinich, and Mike 
Gravel chose to stay on the Michigan ballot. 
<br><br>
Both groups made political decisionwere intended to be to their benefit.

It is likely, that  Barack Obama will be able to claim the 
nomination, by any standard, following the May 20th contests in 
Kentucky and Oregon.  He will be able to claim to have acquired 
more than half of the pledged Delegates and sufficient numbers of 
Super Delegates to hit the magic number. 
<br><br>
And even if Michigan and Florida were fully counted, as the 
Clinton campaign is requesting, the net Delegates which Clinton 
would achieve would not be enough to block Obama. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
Among Democrats and persons who did or would have voted in 
the Democratic primaries, 51% would enthusiastically vote for 
either Clinton or Obama.  17% say they would not vote for Obama 
and 14% say they would not vote for Clinton.  [NBC/WSJ 4/29]

The Obama campaign, any economist that was asked (and some 
that weren't asked), and various media commentators announced... 
often and loudly...that Clinton's proposal for a summer gas tax 
holiday was at best a bad idea and at worst pandering. 
<br><br>
Well, average Americans do not seem to share their view.  By 
54% to 42% they favor the idea, and among lower-income households 
the margin grows to 65% to 30%.  [Gallup 5/08]

What is the impact of race on this election?  That will be a 
subject on which commentators will comment through the general 
election and beyond. 
<br><br>
WW has looked at the results of the various primaries and 
caucuses completed to date in light of the size of the African 
American and Hispanic populations in each state. 
<br><br>
Obama has dominated in those states (+DC) that have the 
smallest percentage of African Americans and in those states that 
have the largest percentage of African Americans. 
<br><br>
He has won 12 of the 15 contests in which the African 
American population is less than 4%, and 10 of the 11 contests in 
which the African American population is greater than 16%.  In 
those 18 states where the population ranges from 4%-16%, Obama 
won 8, while Clinton won 11. 
<br><br>
In those states in which the Hispanic population is less 
than 4%, Obama won 10 of 17 contests.  In those states in which 
the population ranges from 4%-16% Obama won 17 of 22 events.  And 
in those 6 states where the population is greater than 16%, Obama 
won 2, while Clinton won 4.

<h2>The Republican Primary</h2>
John McCain has begun his general election campaigning.  He 
has gone to places that national Republicans generally avoid 
because their potential for Republican votes is so low.  McCain 
is making clear that nothing is off limits. 
<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<h2>The General Election</h2>

When thinking about the general election it is important to 
remember that the contest has not really been joined. 
Prospective voters are not really faced with their final choices
or any pressure to make a lasting decision about who they will 
support. 
<br><br>
The NBC/WSJ survey (4/08) found that potential voters prefer 
to see a Democrat elected President by 51% - 33%, an 18 point 
margin.  But Democratic euphoria was destined to be short lived. 
When McCain is matched with the two potential Democratic 
candidates the results are quite different.

The question on many lips is whether any of these candidates 
has a personal characteristic which makes them unappealing to 
voters.  That does not seem to be the case.  [ABC/WP 5/11] 
<br><br>
<ul> 
<li> 84% are comfortable with a woman President 
<li> 88% are comfortable with an African American President 
<li> 60% are comfortable with a person entering the office of the President at the age of 82

Americans are about equally divided, 47% to 43%. as to 
whether it is more important for a candidate for President to 
have "strength and experience" vs "new direction and new ideas".

Since forever, the United States has been the leader in 
global distribution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  That day is 
coming to an end.  In a recent paper for the National Bureau of 
Economic Research Robert Fogel predicts that, by 2040, China will 
be the leader.  In 2000 the U.S. produced 22% of global GDP, 
followed closely by the European Union (EU) at 21%, and China 
tied for 3rd with a group of SE Asian countries at 11%. 
<br><br>
By 2040, Fogel predicts that China will be first, with 40% 
of global GDP, the U.S. will be second with 14%, and the EU will 
be 5th with 5%.
