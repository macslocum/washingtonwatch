Many Americans are depressed, depressed about the state of 
the country, the state of the federal government and the state of 
their lives. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 72% of Americans believe the country is on the wrong 
track (highest wrong track score in the history of 
the 20 history of the poll).  [NBC/WSJ 4/08] 
<li> 74% think the economy is getting worse. [CBS/NYT 4/08] 
<li> 45% think the nation's economy will get worse during 
the next twelve months (highest number in the 
history of the poll).  [NBC/WSJ 4/08]
<li> 81% believe the United States is in a recession now. 
[NBC/WSJ 4/08] 
<li> 58% are dissatisfied with the state of the U.S. economy 
(highest dissatisfaction in the history of the 
poll).  [NBC/WSJ 4/08] 
<li> 77% rate the national economy as bad. [CBS/NYT 4/08] 
<li> 43% say economic conditions are poor. [Gallup 5/08] 
</ul>


Since forever, the United States has been the leader in 
global distribution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  That day is 
coming to an end.  In a recent paper for the National Bureau of 
Economic Research Robert Fogel predicts that, by 2040, China will 
be the leader.  In 2000 the U.S. produced 22% of global GDP, 
followed closely by the European Union (EU) at 21%, and China 
tied for 3rd with a group of SE Asian countries at 11%. 
<br><br>
By 2040, Fogel predicts that China will be first, with 40% 
of global GDP, the U.S. will be second with 14%, and the EU will 
be 5th with 5%.

<li> 45% are dissatisfied with their personal financial

other than October 2002).  [NBC/WSJ 4/08] 

<li> 68% of Americans are worried about maintaining their 
current standard of living, an increase from 51%

<li> In April, food prices rose at a higher rate (.9%) than 
in any month sine January 1990.  [WP 5/15/08]

Here are a series of findings from Gallup that relate to 
economic issues being faced by Americans.  [Surveys taken during 
April and May] 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 46% of Americans report that recent food prices are 
causing them financial hardship.  But it is worst 
for those making $30,000 or less per year, where 
64% report distress. 
<li> 68% report cutting back on household expenses because 
of the increased cost of gasoline. 
<li> A year ago, 46% said that it was a good time to find a 
quality job. Now that number has dropped to 20%. 
<li> 52% of Americans  believe they are paying too much in 
federal income taxes.  But 60% report the income 
tax they are paying as "fair." 
<li> 49% report that their financial situation is getting 
worse. 
<li> 90% of Americans expect that gas prices will hit $4 
this summer.  74% expect prices to hit $5 per 
gallon.  And 5% think prices will hit $6. (What do 
you think?) 
<li> One in seven U.S. workers fear they will be laid off in 
the next 12 months. [Pew 4/08]</ul>
<br><br>
Women are facing more difficult times than men during 
the current economic crisis. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> real median wages for women dropped 3% in 2007, 
while they only dropped 0.5% for men. 

<li> unemployment has risen higher than for men 

<li> women are 32% more likely then men to have 
subprime mortgages 

<li> women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned 
by men 

<li> non-married women have a net worth 48% lower than 
non-married men.
