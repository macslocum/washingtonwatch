</div>Cousin Jesse was ordained as a Rabbi on May 4th in New York City.  His post-ordination party for family and friends was at Noah's Ark. 
<br><br>
It seats between 80 and 100 people, and, as expected, the tables are close enough so you can participate in the 
conversations of complete strangers. The menu for the luncheon included the following: 
<br><br>
Cup of Chicken Noodle Soup <br>
Corned Beef, Pastrami or Turkey Sandwich <br>
Grilled Veggie Wrap <br>
Large Tossed Salad, Cole Slaw, French Fries, Pickles <br>
Chocolate Chip Cookies, Rugelach, Chocolate Torah Cake 
<br><br>
This is the kind of old style deli in which you start gaining weight when you walk through the door.  Consider some of these offerings on the never-ending menu. 
<br><br>
Pastrami Burger Deluxe - a full 1/2 pound of meat topped with Strips of Grilled Pastrami on a bun, accompanied by steak fries.  You can also get the Pastrami topping on a large frankfurter in a bun. 
<br><br>
Eggs, fried or scrambled, with mixed delicatessen. 
<br><br>
Rueben Wrap - Corned beef, Sauerkraut, & Russian dressing, rolled in a Flour Tortilla. 
<br><br>
Noah's Three Sons - Corned beef, Pastrami & Turkey with 3 slices of bread.  (If you want your meat extra lean, this $18 sandwich costs an extra $1.00.) 
<br><br>
The deli specializes in catering.  Here is an offering called a "Mid-Life Crisis Party."  Serves 40-45 people. 
<br><br>
4 doz Franks in Jackets, 4 doz Mini Potato Knishes, <br>
4 doz Mini Egg rolls, 20 pounds of carved turkey <br>
10 pounds of cold meat platters, 9 pounds each of potato salad and cole slaw, 9 pounds of Rye bread 
<br><br>
The service was deli traditional. Friendly and uncomplicated. 
<br><br>
There are two unisex restrooms.  They are a decent size as restrooms go.  There is a white ceramic commode and sink. Conveniently located next to the commode is a plunger with a traditional black rubber head and wooden handle.
<br><br>
The floor is covered in small blue tiles with a pattern strip of white tiles around the edge.  There are yellow tiles on the walls to about 3 feet, with a border at that height, and off-white tiles covering the rest of the walls. 
Oh yes, there is a fold-down baby changing table. 
<br><br>
It was a special treat to see members of our family (my mother's side), some of whom I had not seen for decades. 
<br><br>
