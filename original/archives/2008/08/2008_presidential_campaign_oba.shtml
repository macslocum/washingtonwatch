<h2>Act I</h2>

This opening act covers the period from June 4th to August 24th. 
<br><br>
While there have been flaps about commercials, and arguments whether 
racism has been injected into the campaign, the reality is that the campaign has 
been flat during most of this period. 
<br><br>
There is periodic criticism of Gallup's daily tracking polls, but if you look at 
them as snapshots over time, they can tell a story.  In the current case, here is the 
snapshot which they present.

The RealClearPolitics average has Obama leading McCain +4.6.  However, 
Obama has never gone over 50%. 

If you look at specific polls outside the average, e.g., NBC/WSJ, CBS, Pew, 
the range is a 5-6 point spread for Obama. 
<br><br>
The potential of a convention bounce for Obama, given that the Republican 
convention starts 3 days later, is unlikely.

<br>

A cautionary note.  In general, polls this far ahead of the general election 
should be considered with a grain of salt as the public is not intensely focused or 
interested.  In particular, no attention should be paid to polls that claim to be able 
to identify likely voters as opposed to registered voters this far ahead of the 
election. 

<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

This race is static and will not really be joined until ACT IV, the debates. 
Potential voters will start paying real attention to the election at that time and it 
will be the first real opportunity for them to judge the two candidates side by side.

McCain is viewed favorably (31%) and unfavorably (32%) by roughly the 
same number of people.  Obama is thought of more favorably (39%) than 
unfavorably (31%).  However, neither Obama or McCain has been able to bust 
through the top of the charts.   [NYT/CBS 7/08]

Respondents to an NBC/WSJ survey asked whether Obama or

Obama scored above 50% on "being easy going and likeable" and "offering

McCain scored above 50% on "being a good commander-in-chief" and

The public has created an interesting picture of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the two candidates for President painted in the most recent 
NBC/WSJ survey.  (Respondents could provide up to two answer to each 
question.) 
<br><br>
Asked what concerns them about McCain's candidacy, the largest number, 
41% say "he would continue George W, Bush's policies."  22% were concerned 
that he was too committed to keeping troops in Iraq, and a similar number thought 
his economic policies would favor the wealthy. 
<br><br>
When asked what qualities McCain should look for in his Vice Presidential 
pick, 60% said "an expert on the economy." 
<br><br>
When asked their concerns about Obama's candidacy, the #1 answer by 33% 
of those asked was "inexperienced and not ready to be President."  20% thought he 
"would not be forceful enough with America's enemies." 
<br><br>
In Obama's Vice Presidential pick, 50% said he should choose an expert in 
military or foreign affairs.

The group of low-wage Americans described in State of the Nation above 
have made a decision about where their interests lie in the Presidential race.  They 
strongly support Barack Obama over John McCain by 58% to 28%.  This includes 
whites 47% to 37%, blacks 96% to 2%, and Hispanics by 61% to 22%. 
<br><br>
59% of this group think that Obama is more concerned with needs of people 
like themselves.  Only 21% have that view of McCain.  56% say Obama better 
represents their personal values than does McCain.  23% say that about McCain.

deciding which candidate will receive a state's electoral votes.  The chart below

A future Washington Watch "Snapshot" will take a more detailed looked at 
electoral votes.  For now, consider the following - the last 4 Presidential elections. 
Two of which were won by Bill Clinton and two of which were won by George 
Bush 

<br><br>
<ul>
<li> States won by Democrat in all 4 elections - 248 votes 
<li> States won by Democrat 3 of last 4 elections -16 votes 
<li> States split by Democrats and GOP - 75 votes 
<li> States won by GOP in 3 of last 4 elections - 64 votes 
<li> States won by GOP in all 4 elections - 135 votes

<br>
Will Obama's foreign trip make a difference in this election?  Early 
indicators are that it did not hurt and it actually helped slightly.  Gallup surveys 
taken before and after the trip found that the response was 35% positive, 26% 
negative, and 39% no opinion.  There was little change in Americans' views as to 
whether Obama can handle the responsibilities of commander in chief.  In fact, 
over half of respondents believe he can handle that part of the job. 
<br><br>
However, in the Final Act and beyond, if he is elected, the trip is likely to 
have been a positive undertaking for Obama. 
<br><br>
You'll recall that Obama and John McCain disagree on whether the 
President should meet with the leaders of foreign countries considered to be 
enemies of the U.S.  The public seems to side with Obama.  67%, including, 79% 
of Democrats, 70% of Independents, and 48% of Republicans, think it is a good 
idea.  [Gallup 5/08] 
<br><br>
Obama has shown he can play on the international stage.

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
56% of all adults, 78% of African Americans, 59% of Hispanics, and 51% 
of non-Hispanic whites, think racism is widespread in the U.S.  [Gallup 8/04] 
<br><br>
Will racism in one form or another affect this race?  Yes, it will.  The 
question is how great the impact? 
<br><br>
The August 2-3 issue of the Wall Street Journal reports that Peter Hart, who 
is part of the bipartisan team that conducts the NBC/WSJ survey, estimates that 
10% of current Democrats and Independents who say they support presumed 
Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama may not be giving fully honest answers, 
based on their response to broader questions about race.  He said "This election is 
exceptionally tricky." 
<br><br>
Even if the candidates themselves appear to avoid the issue of race, their 
supporters directly or indirectly will engage it. And you can count on the media 
doing everything it can to keep the issue live.

<h2>Shades of 2000</h2>

Al Gore may well have lost the 2000 election because mid-way through the 
election he started working at being someone he was not.  If John McCain loses in 
2008, it may well be that it was because he tried to be someone other thmaverick that so many people had come to know and respect.
