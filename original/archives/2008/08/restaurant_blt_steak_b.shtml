					<h3><a href="#">Restaurant: BLT Steak B</a></h3>

<p></p>
<div class="restaurant-box">
<h1>Bistro Laurant Tourondel</h1>
1625 Eye Street <br>
Washington, DC<br>
202-689-8999 <br>
</div>For a variety of reasons there are no restaurant reviews in this edition of 
WW.  However, your editor is inclined to comment about a restaurant in a way 
that has not previously be done in the WW. 
<br><br>
In the last few weeks, your editor has eaten at BLT Steak twice.  Once for 
dinner and once for lunch. 
<br><br>
On both occasions I totally enjoyed the food, the taste, the way it was 
prepared, and the way it was presented. 
<br><br>
In both cases, the folks at the front desk were totally accommodating and 
professional. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I cannot same the same about the table service. 
<br><br>
At dinner there were four of us.  The server's actions ranged from inattentive 
to down right rude. 
<br><br>
At lunch there were two of us.  I was accompanied by a woman friend.  The 
best way to describe the server's attitude was "indifferent."  But the most telling 
moment of service was at the end of the meal. 
<br><br>
The server laid the bill in a traditional folder on the table.  My companion, 
who was paying the bill, took out her credit card, put it in the folder, and placed 
the folder at a location that was clearly closer to her than to me. 
<br><br>
When the server returned with the credit card slip to be signed, he placed 
the folder with the credit card directly in front of me and left. 
<br><br>
My companion and I exchanged knowing looks, she signed the credit card 
slip, and we left. 
<br><br>
By the way, my friend's full name is on her card, including her first name, 
which is clearly a woman's name.
