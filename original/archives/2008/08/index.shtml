<h1>Bistro Laurant Tourondel</h1>
1625 Eye Street <br>
Washington, DC<br>
202-689-8999 <br>
</div>For a variety of reasons there are no restaurant reviews in this edition of 
WW.  However, your editor is inclined to comment about a restaurant in a way 
that has not previously be done in the WW. 
<br><br>
In the last few weeks, your editor has eaten at BLT Steak twice.  Once for 
dinner and once for lunch. 
<br><br>
On both occasions I totally enjoyed the food, the taste, the way it was 
prepared, and the way it was presented. 
<br><br>
In both cases, the folks at the front desk were totally accommodating and 
professional. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I cannot same the same about the table service. 
<br><br>
At dinner there were four of us.  The server's actions ranged from inattentive 
to down right rude. 
<br><br>
At lunch there were two of us.  I was accompanied by a woman friend.  The 
best way to describe the server's attitude was "indifferent."  But the most telling 
moment of service was at the end of the meal. 
<br><br>
The server laid the bill in a traditional folder on the table.  My companion, 
who was paying the bill, took out her credit card, put it in the folder, and placed 
the folder at a location that was clearly closer to her than to me. 
<br><br>
When the server returned with the credit card slip to be signed, he placed 
the folder with the credit card directly in front of me and left. 
<br><br>
My companion and I exchanged knowing looks, she signed the credit card 
slip, and we left. 
<br><br>
By the way, my friend's full name is on her card, including her first name, 
which is clearly a woman's name.

Notably, the real growth in numbers of delegates at either Party 
convention has come up since the last time there was a multi-ballot nomination 
battle in either Party. 
<br><br>
* 1948 - The last time the Republican Party held a multi-ballot nominating 
convention.  Tom Dewey required 3 ballots.  The previous multi-ballot Republican 
nominating battle was in 1940, when Wendall Wilkie needed 6 ballots to secure 
the nomination. 
<br><br>
* 1952 - The last time the Democratic Party held a multi-ballot nomination 
convention.  Adlai Stevenson required 3 ballots.  The previous multi-ballot 
convention was Franklin D. Roosevelt's nomination in 1932 that required 4 
ballots. 
<br><br>
* Since 1960, there have been only three nominating conventions in either 
Party in which the nominee received less than 62% of the votes on the 1st ballot. 
<br><br>
Democrats <br><br>
<ul>
<li> John Kennedy in 1960 - 53% 
<li> Walter Mondale in 1984 - 56% 
</ul>
<br>
Republicans 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Gerry Ford in 1976 - 53% 
</ul>
<h2>Timing</h2>

* By historical practice, the Party controlling the White House has the 2nd 
convention. 
<br><br>
* The shortest period of time between the two conventions was 2 days in 
1956.  The second shortest period is the 3 days spread between the conventions in 
2008. 
<br><br>
* Over the years the timing of the conventions has played a game of "cat and 
mouse" with the Olympics.  In 2000 the Olympics fell after the two conventions were complete.  In 2004 it came between thprecedes both conventions.

* The length of convention plenary sessions has remained relatively static - 
until this year. <br><br>
<ul>
<li> Republicans 16 - 23 hours 
<li> Democrats 28 hours [The 2008 will be substantially shorter] 
</ul>

<h2>Electronic communication </h2>

* 1844 - News of convention proceedings was sent out by telegraph for the 
first time. 
<br><br>
* 1880 - The telephone was first used to transmit convention information. 
<br><br>
* 1924 - The first convention was broadcast on radio, the  Republican 
convention in Cleveland, Ohio. 
<br><br>
* 1940 - The first transmission of reports by a television station came from the 
Republican convention in Philadelphia. 
<br><br>
* 1948 - The first live convention reports were broadcast from the Republican 
convention. 
<br><br>
* The quantity of TV  coverage of conventions and the ratings received by 
that coverage has been dropping steadily. 
<br><br>
* The total aggregate number of hours of coverage of each of the conventions 
by ABC, CBS and NBC (as a group) has dropped steadily over the last 4 
conventions from an average of 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 19.5 hours in 1992 
<li> 14.5 hours in 1996 
<li> 11.0 hours in 2000 
<li> 9.1 hours in 2004 
</ul>
<br>
Beginning with the 1960 conventions, the highest rated Democratic 
convention occurred in 1960 - 29.2.  The highest rated Republican convention was 
1976 - 31.5. 
<br><br>
The aggregate ratings have dropped steadily since 1960, even though the 
number of networks broadcasting important parts of the conventions has grown 
from 3 in 1960 to 7 in 2004.

<h2>The Convention Bounce </h2>

Is there really a so-called convention bounce?  WW has looked at the 
pre/post convention Gallup surveys for each Presidential year going back to 1968. 
In six of the ten conventions since 1968 one or both conventions moved the 
numbers for the nominee of the Party in convention: 1968, 1976, 1980, 1992, 
1996, and 2000. 
<br><br>
Movement after the 1992 Democratic convention was the most dramatic.  In 
the two way race - Bush/Clinton - without Perot, Clinton jumped 16 points and 
Bush dropped 14 points. 
<br><br>
A chart of the relevant data follows with blank spaces in which you can add 
the numbers for 2008.

However, the job performance rating of both Democrat- controlled Houses 
continues to be problematic. 
<br><br>
In four surveys taken between 7/16 and 8/04 the average approval rating of 
19% points ranged from 15% (NBC/WSJ) to 22% (CNN).  The disapproval ratings 
ranged from 68% (Fox) to 77% (CNN) 
<br><br>
The only time in which the NBC/WSJ survey has reflected a higher or 
equivalent disapproval rating was in June '08 (79%) and October '08 (75%).  In 
October '94, when the Democrats lost control of the House after an "endless" 
period of control, the disapproval rating reflected in this survey was 67%. 
<br><br>
Fortunately, for the Democrats the disapproval rating of the Republicans in 
Congress is higher (69%) than the Democrats (57%) and the Democrats have a 10- 
point margin on the approval side.  [WP/ABC 7/13/08] 
<br><br>
Incumbents who have some basis for vulnerability should be nervous.  47% 
of voters believe that a new person should be given a chance to represent them, as 
opposed to 40% who think the incumbent should be re-elected.  [NBC/WSJ 7/08] 
<br>

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 49 </li>
  <li> Republicans 49 </li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem) </li>
</ul>
<br>

There is considerable euphoria on behalf of Democrats as to their prospects 
for a filibuster proof control of the Senate.  The magic number would appear to be 
a 60-vote Democratic caucus (including Independents who caucus with the 
Democrats).  However, this does not tell the whole story. 
<br><br>
The chance of losing a "Democratic caucus" member or two on particular 
matters is certainly within the realm of possibility.   On the other hand, there may 
be as many as 4 members of the Republican caucus, who, on a variety of matters, 
would join with the Democrats to stop a filibuster by their Republican colleagues. 
These Republican members include Arlan Specter, Susan Collins, Olympia 
Snowe, and Gordon Smith.  If Norm Coleman is re-elected, he is also a possibility 
to play this role occasionally. 
<br><br>
All of which is to say that the Democratic leader Harry Reid (D-NV) will 
having increasing numbers of options as the size of the Democratic majority 
increases. 
<br><br>
New Mexico and Alaska are two Republican-controlled seats that now 
appear to be heading toward a Democratic takeover. 
<br><br>
Mark Udall (D) in New Mexico, seems to have this race under control.  In 
this open seat race, Udall has crossed the 50% threshold and runs well ahead of his 
Republican opponents. 
<br><br>
Alaska provides a more complicated scenario.  Senator Ted Stevens, who 
was facing a potentially difficult election, has been indicted by the Federal 
Government for violating Senate  reporting rules.  He has requested an expedited 
trial, which has tentatively been set for September 24th. 
<br><br>
Assuming the trial goes forward at that time, this will not be helpful to 
Republican candidates at large. 
<br><br>
There is another possible scenario.  Stevens has 6 opponents in the state's 
August 26th primary.  If Stevens were to lose, that ends the electoral story.  If he 
wins, some have suggested that he might leave the race anyway, and let the 
Republican Party, which has a state convention on September 17th, pick a 
replacement candidate. 
<br><br>
Oregon moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.  Gordon Smith (R) is 
being challenged by Jeff Merkley (D), the current Speaker of the Oregon House. 
In the most recent publicly available poll, [May 2008] Smith leads Merkley by 4 
points 38% to 34%. 
<br><br>
Minnesota moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican.  Al Franken (D), the 
Democrats great hope to take back the second Minnesota Senate seat and return to 
the glory days of Humphrey, McCarthy and Mondale, is not cutting the mustard. 
He has encountered a series of problems relating to his own history.  Norm 
Coleman (R), the incumbent, is not doing as well as expected, but appears to be 
holding his own against Franken. 
<br><br>
Finally, Kentucky moves from Safe Republican to Leaning Republican. 
Mitch McConnell (R), the Republican Leader in the Senate, leads his opponent by 
roughly 10 points.  However, he is not breaking 50%. 

<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
Among the 4 Toss-Up Races, one of them (Colorado), could well end up in 
Democratic hands in the person of Tom Udall (D) (cousin of Mark). 
<br><br>
In Mississippi (B), Governor Barber (R) appointed incumbent Rodger 
Wicker.  He currently leads Ronnie Musgrove (D), the former governor, by 4 
points, 46%-42%, in a May survey. 
<br><br>
Finally, in New Hampshire, Jean Shaheen (D), the former governor, who 
earlier led incumbent Republican John Sununu by substantial margins, is currently 
not breaking 50%, and is now ahead by only a small handful of points. 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
If the two Independent Senators (a big if) continue to caucus with the 
Democrats, then it is easy to see a Democratic caucus of 55 members. 
<br><br>
And within the mix of Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Oregon it is likely 
that the Democrats will pick up another seat, bringing the number to 56.  From 
there on, it is not so easy. 
<br><br>
Much may depend on where the Obama campaign actually plays. Full-scale, 
Presidential-level, voter turnout campaigns can make the difference in several 
races.  More about that in the next WW.

<h2>The U.S. House of Representatives</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Democrats 236 </li>
  <li> Republicans 199 </li>
</ul>
<br>
Euphoria also seems to be gripping House Democrats.  The estimates of 
additional Democratic seats range from 10 to 25. 
<br><br>
Of the 8 Toss-Up seats that are currently controlled by Democrats, all have 
Republican PVIs* ranging from 0 to 15.  Of the 19 Toss-Up seats that are 
currently held by Republicans, 13 have Republican PVIs ranging from 1 to 14. 
(Note: The R+14 is Republican Don Young's seat in Alaska.  Given all that is 
going on there, Young could have a problem.) 
<br><br>
It appears that on the Democratic side, the caucus will be somewhat more 
conservative than the current caucus.  Most of the newcomers are likely to be Blue 
Dogs, with a few New Dems thrown in for good measure. 
<br><br>
Whether the number of additions is 10 or 25 makes a big difference in 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's ability to work her will in the new Congress.  At 246 seats, 
Pelosi can lose 28 of her colleagues and still control the vote on given issues.  At 
261 seats, she can lose 40 of her members on a given vote and still have a few to 
spare. 
<br><br>
At the end of the day, under any circumstance, if you have an issue on 
which the 60th Speaker is on the other side, you have a big problem.  Whether you 
like her or not, Pelosi is undoubtedly a Speaker of great strength. 
<br><br>
WW's best guess at the moment - 13 to 20 Democratic pickups.

<h2>Act I</h2>

This opening act covers the period from June 4th to August 24th. 
<br><br>
While there have been flaps about commercials, and arguments whether 
racism has been injected into the campaign, the reality is that the campaign has 
been flat during most of this period. 
<br><br>
There is periodic criticism of Gallup's daily tracking polls, but if you look at 
them as snapshots over time, they can tell a story.  In the current case, here is the 
snapshot which they present.

The RealClearPolitics average has Obama leading McCain +4.6.  However, 
Obama has never gone over 50%. 

If you look at specific polls outside the average, e.g., NBC/WSJ, CBS, Pew, 
the range is a 5-6 point spread for Obama. 
<br><br>
The potential of a convention bounce for Obama, given that the Republican 
convention starts 3 days later, is unlikely.

<br>

A cautionary note.  In general, polls this far ahead of the general election 
should be considered with a grain of salt as the public is not intensely focused or 
interested.  In particular, no attention should be paid to polls that claim to be able 
to identify likely voters as opposed to registered voters this far ahead of the 
election. 

<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

This race is static and will not really be joined until ACT IV, the debates. 
Potential voters will start paying real attention to the election at that time and it 
will be the first real opportunity for them to judge the two candidates side by side.

McCain is viewed favorably (31%) and unfavorably (32%) by roughly the 
same number of people.  Obama is thought of more favorably (39%) than 
unfavorably (31%).  However, neither Obama or McCain has been able to bust 
through the top of the charts.   [NYT/CBS 7/08]

Respondents to an NBC/WSJ survey asked whether Obama or 
McCain was better at a number of specific characteristics. 
<br><br>
Obama scored above 50% on "being easy going and likeable" and "offering 
hope and optimism for the future."  McCain scored under 20% on those two items. 
<br><br>
McCain scored above 50% on "being a good commander-in-chief" and 
"being knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the Presidency."  Obama 
scored under 25% on each of those items.

The public has created an interesting picture of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the two candidates for President painted in the most recent 
NBC/WSJ survey.  (Respondents could provide up to two answer to each 
question.) 
<br><br>
Asked what concerns them about McCain's candidacy, the largest number, 
41% say "he would continue George W, Bush's policies."  22% were concerned 
that he was too committed to keeping troops in Iraq, and a similar number thought 
his economic policies would favor the wealthy. 
<br><br>
When asked what qualities McCain should look for in his Vice Presidential 
pick, 60% said "an expert on the economy." 
<br><br>
When asked their concerns about Obama's candidacy, the #1 answer by 33% 
of those asked was "inexperienced and not ready to be President."  20% thought he 
"would not be forceful enough with America's enemies." 
<br><br>
In Obama's Vice Presidential pick, 50% said he should choose an expert in 
military or foreign affairs.

The group of low-wage Americans described in State of the Nation above 
have made a decision about where their interests lie in the Presidential race.  They 
strongly support Barack Obama over John McCain by 58% to 28%.  This includes 
whites 47% to 37%, blacks 96% to 2%, and Hispanics by 61% to 22%. 
<br><br>
59% of this group think that Obama is more concerned with needs of people 
like themselves.  Only 21% have that view of McCain.  56% say Obama better 
represents their personal values than does McCain.  23% say that about McCain.

A future Washington Watch "Snapshot" will take a more detailed looked at 
electoral votes.  For now, consider the following - the last 4 Presidential elections. 
Two of which were won by Bill Clinton and two of which were won by George 
Bush 

<br><br>
<ul>
<li> States won by Democrat in all 4 elections - 248 votes 
<li> States won by Democrat 3 of last 4 elections -16 votes 
<li> States split by Democrats and GOP - 75 votes 
<li> States won by GOP in 3 of last 4 elections - 64 votes 
<li> States won by GOP in all 4 elections - 135 votes

Will Obama's foreign trip make a difference in this election?  Early 
indicators are that it did not hurt and it actually helped slightly.  Gallup surveys 
taken before and after the trip found that the response was 35% positive, 26% 
negative, and 39% no opinion.  There was little change in Americans' views as to 
whether Obama can handle the responsibilities of commander in chief.  In fact, 
over half of respondents believe he can handle that part of the job. 
<br><br>
However, in the Final Act and beyond, if he is elected, the trip is likely to 
have been a positive undertaking for Obama. 
<br><br>
You'll recall that Obama and John McCain disagree on whether the 
President should meet with the leaders of foreign countries considered to be 
enemies of the U.S.  The public seems to side with Obama.  67%, including, 79% 
of Democrats, 70% of Independents, and 48% of Republicans, think it is a good 
idea.  [Gallup 5/08]

56% of all adults, 78% of African Americans, 59% of Hispanics, and 51% 
of non-Hispanic whites, think racism is widespread in the U.S.  [Gallup 8/04] 
<br><br>
Will racism in one form or another affect this race?  Yes, it will.  The 
question is how great the impact? 
<br><br>
The August 2-3 issue of the Wall Street Journal reports that Peter Hart, who 
is part of the bipartisan team that conducts the NBC/WSJ survey, estimates that 
10% of current Democrats and Independents who say they support presumed 
Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama may not be giving fully honest answers, 
based on their response to broader questions about race.  He said "This election is 
exceptionally tricky." 
<br><br>
Even if the candidates themselves appear to avoid the issue of race, their 
supporters directly or indirectly will engage it. And you can count on the media 
doing everything it can to keep the issue live.

Al Gore may well have lost the 2000 election because mid-way through the 
election he started working at being someone he was not.  If John McCain loses in 
2008, it may well be that it was because he tried to be someone other thmaverick that so many people had come to know and respect.

                                 The Democratic and Republican conventions are anachronisms at best.  At 
worst they are the biggest waste of money in modern Presidential campaigns. 
<br><br>
The best argument for watching the conventions this year is that nothing 
like them is likely to be seen again. 
<br><br>
Neither Party has had a multi-ballot convention since 1952. The last 
Republican convention to go beyond the 1st ballot was in 1948, when it took 3 
ballots for Tom Dewey to secure the nomination.  The last Democratic convention 
that required more than one ballot was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson needed 3 
ballots to secure his place in history. 
<br><br>
What's more, since 1956 there have only been 3 conventions in which the 
ultimate nominee got less than 62% of the vote on the first ballot.  The exceptions 
were 
<br><br>

<ul>
<li> the Democratic convention in 1960 when John Kennedy received 
53% of the vote on the 1st ballot 
<li> the Democratic convention in 1984 when Walter Mondale received 
56% of the vote 
<li> the Republican convention in 1976 when Gerry Ford got 53% of the 
vote
</ul> 

<br>
The delegates and alternates have been reduced to the status of extras in a 
carefully staged theatrical production. 
<br><br>
In 1960, the three TV networks that carried the conventions received an 
average rating of 28.5. (i.e., 28.5% of potential viewers watched all or part of 
them).  By 2004, with 7 TV and cable networks providing coverage, the average 
rating was 16. 
<br><br>
In 2004 WW estimated that the Democratic convention in Boston cost 
something between $150-200 million dollars before the first delegate booked a flight, rented a room or purchased a meal.  This does not take into account the tens 
of millions that various networks spend covering these events. 
<br><br>
Given that the current delegate apportionment rules of the two Parties make 
it unlikely that there will be a need for a multi-ballot convention anytime soon, 
why do the Parties continue to produce these extravaganzas? 
<br><br>
One reason is inertia.  Neither Party wants to be the first to change the 
format, although it is hard to understand the argument for continuing. 
<br><br>
Another argument is that the conventions provide an opportunity for the 
Party's leadership to come together every four years. 
<br><br>
Perhaps the best argument for these conventions is that they provide the 
largest audience which a Party's nominee will enjoy until his or her inaugural, and 
a venue in which they have absolute control over the message.  It is also the 
largest "solo" audience that the Party's Vice Presidential nominee will enjoy, 
unless he or she runs for President. 
<br><br>
These two worthwhile goals could easily be achieved without resorting to 
the machinations of the current conventions. 
<br><br>
Most of the Party-building activity at these conventions actually occurs 
outside of the hall. 
<br><br>
And what is the likelihood that TV and cable would not cover the 
acceptance speeches of the Party's nominees if the events were held in the kind of 
setting that most large national conventions enjoy? 
<br><br>
And if the day comes when there is again a multi-ballot convention, 
conducting that contest certainly does not require the constructive modification of 
a basketball/hockey arena. 
<br><br>
But perhaps the biggest driver of a change in the nature of these 
conventions will be the fact that few if any cities will bid to host these gatherings in the future, unless there is substantial modification of the requirements.

<br>
The Democratic convention will be held from August 25-28, 2008, in 
Denver Colorado. 
<br><br>
The Republicans will follow almost immediately, holding their convention 
September 1-4, 2008, in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. 
<br><br>
This year's Democratic convention is taking the first steps to modify the 
structure of its convention.  Before its nominee was selected the director of the 
convention had decided to shorten each day's plenary session from 7 to 5 hours. 
<br><br>
The Obama campaign has made further modifications since he became the 
presumptive nominee.  There will only be full-scale plenary sessions on Monday 
through Wednesday.  Tentatively, on Monday and Wednesday the sessions will be 
5 hours long and on Tuesday it will be in session for 6 hours. 
<br><br>
This means each session will start at either 3:00 or 4:00 o'clock p.m. and 
conclude by 9:00 p.m. MDT. 
<br><br>
But of greatest significance is the 4th day's session.  This session will meet 
in the evening and has been moved from the Pepsi Center to Invesco Field at Mile 
High Stadium, the home of the Denver Broncos football team.  It has a seating 
capacity of 76,000.  In addition to regular delegates, alternates and guests will 
meet there, rather than at the Pepsi Center.  Some 60,000 tickets will be issued to 
the general public to help form the audience for Barack Obama's acceptance 
speech. 
<br><br>
Requests for all 60,000 seats available to the public were received within 18 
hours after the announcement of their availability. 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The Republicans have always had shorter plenary sessions compared to 
Democrats sessions.  This year will be similar in length to those in the past. 
<br><br>
The 4 days of the Republican convention will be held at the Xcel Energy 
Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
<br><br>
The schedule as announced by the convention committee follows (all times are CDT): 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Monday,  2:30 - 10:00 p.m. (30 minute break at 6:30 p.m.) 
<li> Tuesday, 6:20 - 10:05 p.m. 
<li> Wednesday, 6:20 - 11:20 p.m. 
<li> Thursday, 6:20 - 10:15 p.m. 
</ul>

<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The major TV networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, are expected to provide live 
coverage of both conventions for an hour each day, 10:00 - 11:00 p.m. EST.  PBS 
and various cable networks will provide more expanded coverage.  For those who 
are eager not to miss a word, CSPAN will, as usual, provide gavel-to-gavel 
coverage of both conventions. 
<br><br>

As of now, what appears to be known about the schedule of speakers at the 
two conventions are: 
<br><br>
Republicans:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Monday - President Bush and Vice President Cheney 
<li> Tuesday - ? 
<li> Wednesday - Vice Presidential nominee 
<li> Thursday - Senator John McCain 
</ul>
<br>
Demorats:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Monday - Michelle Obama; Senator Kennedy Tribute; Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
<li> Tuesday - Senator Hillary Clinton; Mark Warner, Keynoter 
<li> Wednesday - Vice Presidential nominee; President Bill Clinton 
<li> Thursday - Senator Barack Obama 
</ul>

Malia (age 10) nodded. "Well, African-Americans used to be slaves and we 
couldn't vote and we didn't have many rights, so of course this is a big deal."  Then 
she added, "Just like it would also be a really big deal if Hillary Clinton had won,

His 64% disapproval rating on his overall job performance is at a near

slightly larger number(46%) rate it as "poor" 
<li> 82% find it difficult to afford transportation or gasoline costs; a 
similar number cannot afford to save for retirement 
<li> 75% say it has become increasingly difficult to find good jobs 
</ul>

following

<ul>
<li> 70% minimized the use of electricity 
<li> 62% have taken an extra job or worked extra hours 
<li> 51% postponed medical or dental care 
<li> 50% have taken money out of savings or retirement funds 
<li> 41% borrowed money from friends or relatives 
<li> 27% changed their housing situation 
<li> 26% increased credit card debt

meet the needs of people."  43% say the government is doing "too many thibetter left to businesses and individuals."  [NBC/WSJ 7/08]
