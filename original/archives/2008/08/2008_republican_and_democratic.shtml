					<h3><a href="#">2008 Republican And Democratic Conventions</a></h3>

<p></p>
The Democratic and Republican conventions are anachronisms at best.  At 
worst they are the biggest waste of money in modern Presidential campaigns. 
<br><br>
The best argument for watching the conventions this year is that nothing 
like them is likely to be seen again. 
<br><br>
Neither Party has had a multi-ballot convention since 1952. The last 
Republican convention to go beyond the 1st ballot was in 1948, when it took 3 
ballots for Tom Dewey to secure the nomination.  The last Democratic convention 
that required more than one ballot was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson needed 3 
ballots to secure his place in history. 
<br><br>
What's more, since 1956 there have only been 3 conventions in which the 
ultimate nominee got less than 62% of the vote on the first ballot.  The exceptions 
were 
<br><br>

<ul>
<li> the Democratic convention in 1960 when John Kennedy received 
53% of the vote on the 1st ballot 
<li> the Democratic convention in 1984 when Walter Mondale received 
56% of the vote 
<li> the Republican convention in 1976 when Gerry Ford got 53% of the 
vote
</ul> 

<br>
The delegates and alternates have been reduced to the status of extras in a 
carefully staged theatrical production. 
<br><br>
In 1960, the three TV networks that carried the conventions received an 
average rating of 28.5. (i.e., 28.5% of potential viewers watched all or part of 
them).  By 2004, with 7 TV and cable networks providing coverage, the average 
rating was 16. 
<br><br>
In 2004 WW estimated that the Democratic convention in Boston cost 
something between $150-200 million dollars before the first delegate booked a flight, rented a room or purchased a meal.  This does not take into account the tens 
of millions that various networks spend covering these events. 
<br><br>
Given that the current delegate apportionment rules of the two Parties make 
it unlikely that there will be a need for a multi-ballot convention anytime soon, 
why do the Parties continue to produce these extravaganzas? 
<br><br>
One reason is inertia.  Neither Party wants to be the first to change the 
format, although it is hard to understand the argument for continuing. 
<br><br>
Another argument is that the conventions provide an opportunity for the 
Party's leadership to come together every four years. 
<br><br>
Perhaps the best argument for these conventions is that they provide the 
largest audience which a Party's nominee will enjoy until his or her inaugural, and 
a venue in which they have absolute control over the message.  It is also the 
largest "solo" audience that the Party's Vice Presidential nominee will enjoy, 
unless he or she runs for President. 
<br><br>
These two worthwhile goals could easily be achieved without resorting to 
the machinations of the current conventions. 
<br><br>
Most of the Party-building activity at these conventions actually occurs 
outside of the hall. 
<br><br>
And what is the likelihood that TV and cable would not cover the 
acceptance speeches of the Party's nominees if the events were held in the kind of 
setting that most large national conventions enjoy? 
<br><br>
And if the day comes when there is again a multi-ballot convention, 
conducting that contest certainly does not require the constructive modification of 
a basketball/hockey arena. 
<br><br>
But perhaps the biggest driver of a change in the nature of these 
conventions will be the fact that few if any cities will bid to host these gatherings in the future, unless there is substantial modification of the requirements.

<br>
The Democratic convention will be held from August 25-28, 2008, in 
Denver Colorado. 
<br><br>
The Republicans will follow almost immediately, holding their convention 
September 1-4, 2008, in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. 
<br><br>
This year's Democratic convention is taking the first steps to modify the 
structure of its convention.  Before its nominee was selected the director of the 
convention had decided to shorten each day's plenary session from 7 to 5 hours. 
<br><br>
The Obama campaign has made further modifications since he became the 
presumptive nominee.  There will only be full-scale plenary sessions on Monday 
through Wednesday.  Tentatively, on Monday and Wednesday the sessions will be 
5 hours long and on Tuesday it will be in session for 6 hours. 
<br><br>
This means each session will start at either 3:00 or 4:00 o'clock p.m. and 
conclude by 9:00 p.m. MDT. 
<br><br>
But of greatest significance is the 4th day's session.  This session will meet 
in the evening and has been moved from the Pepsi Center to Invesco Field at Mile 
High Stadium, the home of the Denver Broncos football team.  It has a seating 
capacity of 76,000.  In addition to regular delegates, alternates and guests will 
meet there, rather than at the Pepsi Center.  Some 60,000 tickets will be issued to 
the general public to help form the audience for Barack Obama's acceptance 
speech. 
<br><br>
Requests for all 60,000 seats available to the public were received within 18 
hours after the announcement of their availability. 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The Republicans have always had shorter plenary sessions compared to 
Democrats sessions.  This year will be similar in length to those in the past. 
<br><br>
The 4 days of the Republican convention will be held at the Xcel Energy 
Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
<br><br>
The schedule as announced by the convention committee follows (all times are CDT): 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Monday,  2:30 - 10:00 p.m. (30 minute break at 6:30 p.m.) 
<li> Tuesday, 6:20 - 10:05 p.m. 
<li> Wednesday, 6:20 - 11:20 p.m. 
<li> Thursday, 6:20 - 10:15 p.m. 
</ul>

<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The major TV networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, are expected to provide live 
coverage of both conventions for an hour each day, 10:00 - 11:00 p.m. EST.  PBS 
and various cable networks will provide more expanded coverage.  For those who 
are eager not to miss a word, CSPAN will, as usual, provide gavel-to-gavel 
coverage of both conventions. 
<br><br>

As of now, what appears to be known about the schedule of speakers at the 
two conventions are: 
<br><br>
Republicans:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Monday - President Bush and Vice President Cheney 
<li> Tuesday - ? 
<li> Wednesday - Vice Presidential nominee 
<li> Thursday - Senator John McCain 
</ul>
<br>
Demorats:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Monday - Michelle Obama; Senator Kennedy Tribute; Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
<li> Tuesday - Senator Hillary Clinton; Mark Warner, Keynoter 
<li> Wednesday - Vice Presidential nominee; President Bill Clinton 
<li> Thursday - Senator Barack Obama 
</ul>
<br>

<br>

This is the first Democratic convention in the memory of WW in 
which the spouse of a non-incumbent nominee is a  headline speaker on the first 
night of the convention.

[Note: Your editor has participated in some fashion in every Democratic 
national convention from 1968 through 2004.  In 1976, 1980, 1992, 1996, 2000, 
and 2004 I scheduled the plenary sessions.  And I certainly did participate in 
extending the plenary sessions of the Democratic party.  In fact, it was likely my 
idea.]
