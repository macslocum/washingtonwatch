Between 1998 and 2004, 43% of all retiring members of Congress - 283 
retired members - opted to become professional lobbyists, according to a study 
done by Public Citizen.

Consider the following: 
<br><br>
Growing old is mandatory; growing up is optional. 
<br><br>
Forget the health foods. I need all the preservatives I can get. 
<br><br>
It's frustrating when you know all the answers, but nobody bothers to ask 
you the questions. 
<br><br>
Wisdom comes with age, but sometimes age comes alone. 
<br><br>
A billion seconds ago it was 1959. 
<br><br>
A billion days ago, no-one walked on the earth on two feet. 
<br><br>
A billion dollars ago was only 8 hours and 20 minutes at the rate our 
government is spending it.
