After Barack Obama sewed up the nomination, Michelle Obama flew home 
to be with their daughters when they woke up the next morning.  She proceeded to 
explain to them what had happened the night before. "They basically said, 'Oh, 
good. Daddy won.'  Michelle tried again, "This is a really big deal.  There's never 
been an African-American nominee for President.  Do you guys realize the 
significance of this?" 
<br><br>
Malia (age 10) nodded. "Well, African-Americans used to be slaves and we 
couldn't vote and we didn't have many rights, so of course this is a big deal."  Then 
she added, "Just like it would also be a really big deal if Hillary Clinton had won, 
because there has never been a woman nominee for President and women used to 
not be able to vote and didn't have many rights either."
