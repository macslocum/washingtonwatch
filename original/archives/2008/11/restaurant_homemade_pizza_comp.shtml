<h1>Homemade Pizza Company</h1>
4857 Massachusetts Avenue <br>
Spring Valley Shopping Center (Next to Wagshall's Deli) <br>

13300 Franklin Farm Road., Herndon, VA

<a href="http://www.homemadepizza.com">www.homemadepizza.com</a></div>In the ordinary course, you order a pizza to go and pick it up, or you order it  to be delivered.  In either case, it is some time between the time it is cooked and  the time you dig into it.  
<br><br>
Homemade Pizza guarantees freshly cooked and hot-out-of-the-oven pizza 
every time.  Homemade Pizza sells its pizzas <i>uncooked</i>. 
<br><br>
You can call in and it will be ready for you in 15-20 minutes, or you can go 
directly to their location, place your order, and knock around for 15-20 minutes. 
(At the Spring Valley location, you can shop at Wagshall's or the CVS.) 
<br><br>
First you select the regular crust or a whole wheat crust. It is then topped 
with HomeMade tomato sauce, an olive oil glaze, or fresh pesto and Wisconsin 
mozzarella. 
<br><br>
Then you add a variety of ingredients which are available online, from a 
pamphlet that is readily available, or on the wall. 
<br><br>
I selected barbecue chicken, caramelized onions and mushrooms. 
<br><br>
It is then packaged in a clear plastic wrap that is tented and loose so it does 
not touch the pizza. 
<br><br>
Cooking directions come with each pizza, but basically you pre-heat your 
oven to 425, and cook the pizza for about 15 minutes. 
<br><br>
There is one other clever touch which aids cooking.  The pizza comes on a 
form of parchment which is folded at the edges, and then it is placed on a 
cardboard which keeps the package firm. 
<br><br>
When you are ready to cook it, you fold out the parchment and slide it off 
the cardboard and on to the middle rack of the oven.  Because the parchment is 
larger than the pie, nothing leaks onto the bottom of your oven.  When it is 
finished, you easily slide the cardboard back under the parchment and take it from 
the oven.
<br><br>
You can also select a variety of excellent salads, big cookies, and excellent 
ice cream. 
<br><br>
You can pick up the pizza or have it delivered for an additional charge. 
The hours are 3-9 p.m.,  Monday thru Thursday, and 1-9 p.m., Friday thru 
Sunday. 
<br><br>
There are HomeMade Pizza stores in several states.  The locations are 
available on the internet.
