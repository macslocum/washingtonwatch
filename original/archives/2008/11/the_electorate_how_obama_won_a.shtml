					<h3><a href="#">The Electorate: How Obama Won And How McCain Lost</a></h3>

<p></p>
1. There is something about Obama that caught the imagination of a whole 
lot of Americans. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> The Iraq war and his position on it provided him an opportunity.</li>

<li> His basic speech, which was short on specifics, offered folks the 
opportunity to believe that if they had a need or an aspiration, he 
understood it and would do something to help them achieve it. </li>

<li> Loss of support for President Bush and his Administration provided a 
convenient backdrop for Obama's message of change.  In addition to 
President Bush's record low approval ratings, he is held primarily 
accountable for the meltdown of the financial system. </li>
</ul>

2. The more potential voters came to know John McCain, the less it appears 
they were attracted to him as a possible President. </li>
<br><br>
3. Obama was a natural candidate for the democratic base.  John McCain 
was not a natural candidate for the Republican base. </li>
<br><br>
4. Obama and his team ran an exceptional campaign. </li>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Looking at it from the outside and observing results, it was the kind 
of campaign that those of us who have been involved in the past have 
always dreamed about. </li>

<li> Stumbles along the way did not pull them off their game plan.  The 
same people were in charge of the campaign at the end of the 
campaign as were in charge on the first day.</li>

<li> This has been a campaign with less obvious internal drama than any 
in modern memory. </li>

<li> The voter contact program was beyond state-of-the-art.  It created a 
new state-of-the-art and was fully funded. </li.

<li> The Republican database has been more up-to-date and user friendly 
than that available to Democrats for years and years.  That advantage 
is gone. </li>

<li> Catalist, a new company that created and operates the database used 
primarily by the Obama campaign (as well as others during the 
primary season), is state-of-the-art, with an architecture that makes it 
more useful than the DNC list, which is also in far better shape than 
at anytime in history. </li>

<li> Here is an example of an Obama field operation. 
<br><br>
Alfred Johnson, a June college graduate, was the field 
director for 8 counties in northern New Mexico 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> There were 187,661 registered voters of which 122,993 were Democrats</li>
<li> 8 field offices, with 13 paid staff </li>
<li> 45 non-paid full-time staff </li>
<li> thousands of volunteers </li>
<li> 2,627 canvassers on election day </li>
<li> 300,000 geo-coded doors knocked in 3 months </li>
<li> blind canvases in every town with a population greater than 400 </li>
<li> Obama won the 8-county area 75.3% to 24.7%. 
<ul><li>101,530 votes to 33,305 votes</li></ul></li>
<li> Kerry won the area in 2004 63% to 37%
<ul><li>87,743 votes to 41,328 votes </li></ul></li>
<li> Obama won the State 57% to 42%; Kerry lost the State 49% to 50% </li></ul></li>

5. The McCain campaign went through a series of ups and downs and 
changes. <br><br>
<ul>
<li> Overall campaign plan was not obvious</li>
<li> Theme seemed to change from week to week and month to month </li>
<li> Message was weak, resulting in weak strategy</li>
<li> For a period of time one needed a score card to keep track of who was 
in charge. </li>
<li> The voter turnout program was a rehash of a program that was used 
successfully twice by President Bush, but it had not been brought up 
to speed.  McCain did not have the necessary resources available to 
fully implement it. </li>
</ul>

6. Obama's success at fundraising and his decision not to take Federal 
funds in the general election gave him an important advantage throughout the long 
campaign.  Perhaps as much as $150-$200,000,000. <br><br>
<ul>
<li> McCain's decision to stick with Federal funding,  probably his only 
realistic option resulted in his campaign operating at a substantial 
financial disadvantage. </li></ul>

7. May 13, 2006 is the day on which John McCain took the first step 
toward losing the 2008 Presidential campaign <br><br>
<ul>
<li> McCain spoke at Liberty University's graduation, having made 
"peace" the preceding Fall with the Reverends Falwell and Robertson. 
He previously had called Falwell an "agent of intolerance." </li>

<li> McCain had had a long-running "love affair" with the national media. 
The speech at Liberty University caused that "love affair" begin to 
fall apart. </li>
<li> John McCain forgot who he was.  His stature and attractiveness 
deteriorated as the campaign wore on, as did his romance with the 
media. </li>
<li> Saying that he knew little about the economy, when it was destined to 
be the most important issue of the campaign, along with some of the 
decisions he made, did not accrue to his benefit. </li>
<li> He showed a temperament that did not encourage confidence in how 
he would act as a leader. </li>
<li> His selection of Governor Palin created further doubt about his 
judgement.</li>
</ul>

8. As the media paid more attention to Obama, they started to fall in love with him.  Since their love affair with McCain was coming to an end, it made it easier for them to shift their love. <br><br>
<ul>
<li> They turned away from McCain with a vengeance.  A study was done of the positive and negative references to McCain and Obama on the regular news programs of the 4 broad cast TV networks...ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox. (Cable networks were not included.) ABC was found to be most balanced, followed by Fox.<br><br>

9. The final straw that doomed McCain's campaign was the financial 
meltdown.

<b>Another View</b>
<br><br>

Peter Hart, with the assistance of Alex Horowitz, conducted  a post-election 
focus group in the Virginia exurbs, as part of the series conducted for the 
Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. 
<br><br>
All 12 voters in the group voted for Barack Obama, but did not start there. 
8 of the 12 voted for Bush in 2004, 9 considered voting for McCain at some stage 
of the election, 6 were Republicans or Republican-leaning Independents. 
<br><br>
The following are selected quotes from a memorandum that summarized the 
group discussion. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> "these voters wanted change" and "change that would lead to a 
government of action and a government of accountability and 
transparency." </li>

<li> "Obama was 'fresh','true to his word','a person who radiated both self- 
awareness and calm." </li>

<li> "When asked about the single moment of voting for Obama, people 
described it as 'historic', 'exciting, 'a sense of relief' and more than a 
few felt 'anxious' or 'nervous'". </li>

<li> "the President-elect is going to receive a great deal of latitude from 
these swing voters.  The judgements about him are more likely to be 
based on the way he approaches the problems and not by 
instantaneous results." </li>

<li> "The personal relationship these voters have to Barack Obama is 
different from anything we have measured with previous Presidents." </li>

<li> "They are with Obama because he is what they want for America - 
fresh, straight shooter, genuine, sincere."</li></ul>

<br>

<br>
<b>Who And How Many Came To The Election?</b>
<br><br>
To date (11/21), 127,142,278 people voted for President in 2008.  That 
number will grow.  It takes several weeks for all votes to be tabulated.  This 
compares with the 122,295,000 who voted in that race in 2004.
<br><br>
It is still quite possible that the total turnout will reach 130,000,000. 
From 1968 through 2004 the average increase in voter turnout has been 7%, 
ranging from a high of 16% between 2000 and 2004, and a low of a -7.8% 
between 1992 and 1996. 
<br><br>
So far the increase from 2004 to 2008 is 3.9%. 
<br><br>
About 30% of total votes were cast early in one form or another.  This is up 
from roughly 20% in 2004 and 7% in 2000.  Early voting relieves pressure on the 
polls on election day.  The likely result is that States which do not provide for "in 
person early voting" or which have particularly stringent rules for absentee voting, 
will feel pressure to make voting more accessible. 
<br><br>
[In <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/snapshots/snapshot4.shtml">Snapshot 4</a> there is a discussion of turnout.  There was a computation  error in determining the percentage growth in participation from one Presidential 
election to the next.  So, erase it from your mind and rely on the information above 
and <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pi0wzm4Pw-we01TSJebBGBQ">this chart</a>.] 
<br>
<br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>
As in a number of recent elections, much has been made of the potential 
increased participation of young people between the ages of 18-29.  While there 
was an increase in the number of young people who participated in 2008, their 
share of the actual voting pool which they represent increased only slightly, from 
17% in 2000 and 2004 to 18% in 2008. 
<br><br>
In short, young people, as voters continue to underperform their percentage 
of the eligible population.  Their's is the only group that represents a smaller 
portion of the voting pool than its share of the population.

<ul>
<li> Ohio - by 4 pts (21% to 17%) </li>
<li> Florida - by 2 pts (17% to 15%) </li>
<li> Colorado - by 1 pt (15% to 14%)</li>

There has been little change in how Americans describe their political 
views, conservative, moderate or liberal.  While young people are seen as the most liberal, with 27% self-describing themselves as liberal, it is not an overwhelming 
number.

<b>The Money Game</b>
<br><br>
While the final tabulations for the amounts of money spent by Presidential 
candidates are not yet available for the 2008 campaign, there are some things we 
do know. 
<br><br>
Total spending by Presidential candidates in 2008 will be more than double 
what it was in 2004, and 2004 was more than double 2000.  Based on reports filed 
through October 20th, $1,324,700,000 was spent in 2008, as compared to 
$717,900.000 in 2004, and $343,100,000 in 2000.
