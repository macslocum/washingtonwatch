65% of Americans are confident in Barack Obama's ability to be a good 
President. This includes 89% of Democrats, 64% of Independents, and 28% of 
Republicans.  In each of these categories those between the ages of 18-34 are more 
positive than other age groups.  For example, 42% of Republicans in this age 
group are confident in his ability to do the job.

<br>
61% of consumers consider current economic conditions to be poor.  And 
80% say conditions are getting worse. 
<br>
<br>
Only 12% think that now is a good time to get a quality job.  86% say it is a 
bad time.  [Gallup 11/25,20,24]

Consumer confidence is at the lowest it has been in the 22 years of the 
weekly ABC News Consumer Index.  It currently has settled at a -52. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 68% plan to wait for holiday sales 
<li> 51% plan to spend less this year than last (most depressed number 
since 1991) 
<li> 2% rate economy as excellent; 60% rate it poor 
<li> 43% say personal finances are excellent/good 
<li> 57% not good/poor 
<li> 21% say this is an excellent/good time buy things 
<li> 79%  not good/poor </ul>

Consumer spending fell 1% in October, the largest one-month drop since 
9/11/01. 

Jobless claims rose to an adjusted 542,000 last week, the highest since 1992, 
and the 4 week average was 506,500, the highest in 25 years.  [Keep in mind that 
comparisons to previous years are leavened by the fact that the relevant population 
was lower in those previous years.]

President-elect Obama says he intends to change the way Washington 
works.  Whichever way Washington works, it has worked this way for a long time. 
Obama may find that it makes sense to use the way Washington works (in the best 
sense of that phrase) to achieve the goals which he has described to the American 
people.
