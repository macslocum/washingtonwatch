<h1>Bistro Le Zinc</h1>
3714 Macomb Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20016<br>
202-686-2015</div>Debbie and I were with Tom and Linda on our third visit to Le Zinc.  On our first visit many months ago, things were a little ragged, so I did not write about it. But the second and third visits were quite good, so it seems time to share our experience.
<br><br>
	The restaurant is fairly narrow.  On the main level, as you come in, there are tables of various sizes along the right hand wall and several tables to the left, starting about half way into the restaurant.  To the left there is a balcony several steps up, where there are additional tables which can be combined into a single table for a large group.
<br><br>
	Linda and Debbie started with the Goat Cheese Salad.  Tom opted for the Pear and Gorgonzola Salad, and I had the Classic French Onion Soup.
<br><br>
	For main courses, Debbie and Tom selected the Rockfish special.  Linda went with Mussels, and I savored Smoked Lancaster Chicken.
<br><br>
	For dessert we shared Crepes with Ice cream and Berries topped with Zabaglione sauce.
<br><br>
	The men's room is relatively small, but includes a white ceramic commode and a square white ceramic washbasin with rounded corners. The walls are red, and the floor is covered with very small mixed tiles.
<br><br>
	Parking is on the street.
<br><br>
	Lunch is served Tuesday through Friday, and dinner Tuesday through Sunday.
