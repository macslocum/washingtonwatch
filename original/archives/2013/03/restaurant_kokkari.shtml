	Debbie and I went to Kokkari with John and Sue.
<br><br>
	You enter this restaurant at a far corner of a large dining room that turns out to be one of two large dining rooms.  The restaurant has a variety of private rooms that  can become part of the main restaurant. 
<br><br>
	To the far left is long bar with about 15 high chairs/stools.  Behind the bar is a large mirror with glass shelves holding a vast array of liquors and liqueurs.
<br><br>
	There are two large dining rooms hold an array of 2s, 4s, 6s, booths of four, and a community table that looks to seat about 20. The path to the community table is a bit circuitous.  There are also a number of private rooms, which can be opened for general restaurant seating.  All-in-all, the restaurant seats about 180 people. While the tables are relatively close to each other, they seemed to have been placed to allow for the greatest amount of private conversation.
<br><br>
	Each of the two main dining rooms has a large table which holds an endless amount of freshly baked bread and a carving station, so that servers can prepare an ample breadbasket for each table. 
<br><br>
	Sue and John started the meal with Fakes Supa - lentil, vegetable soup with braised greens.  For her main course, Sue had two appetizers: Octapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil, and Mapakia - wood oven-roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and Lemon.
<br><br>
	Debbie started her meal with Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing.  I had Pantzaria - roasted beets with Greek yogurt and pistachio.
<br><br>
	For her main course Debbie chose Rotisserie, slow roasted Napa Valley spring lamb served over roasted potatoes.  John and I selected slow roasted Goat shavings over Orzo Past, Feta, Tomato Sauce, and Artichoke.
<br><br>
	For dessert we ordered two, very large, hot fudge sundaes (skipping the whipped cream).
<br><br>
	Getting to the restrooms is a bit of an adventure.  From where we were seated in a corner booth on the outside wall of the first dining room, one has to work oneâ€™s way through both dining rooms and down a long hall, to reach an elevator that takes you to the area in which the restrooms are located. 
<br><br>
	The men's room had a single wall-attached white ceramic urinal and a fully enclosed commode room with a white ceramic commode.  There are two hand washing stations with dark wooden counters, sunken white ceramic washbasins, and appropriate mirrors.  The floor is dark brown and the walls are a light tan with a greenish hue.
<br><br>
	In chatting with our server, who was well informed about the menu and really quite delightful, we learned that she works 30 hours a week at the restaurant while attending college full-time.  What she earns at the restaurant, plus a grant from the state of California, will enable her to finish her schooling without student debt.  
<br><br>
	Reservations are necessary.  The night we were there, a Thursday, the entire restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7 p.m. and packed when we left around 9:30 p.m.
