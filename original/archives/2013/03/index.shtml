1090 Point Lobos<br>
San Francisco, CA 94121<br>

<a href="http://www.cliffhouse.com">www.cliffhouse.com</a></div>

	During one day of our California visit, Debbie and I spent a good chunk of the day checking out the sights of the Bay Area.  Beginning with a walking tour of Muir Woods, we went from place to place.  At lunchtime we ended up at Cliff House. 
<br><br>
	Cliff House has several observation areas and it is worth checking out each of them.  On this particular day there were no seals in evidence, but an endless number of birds were hanging out on the various islands.   
<br><br>
	There are two restaurants in Cliff House.  One is the Bistro, which is on the main floor.  It is the most casual of the two restaurants.  It includes two separate bar areas.  No reservations are necessary, but there can be a wait at the height of  meal time.  
<br><br>
We ended up in Sutro’s, which does take reservations, and has the best view of the ocean and several small rocky islands, which historically are hangouts for seals.  We were lucky enough to get a table for two right at one of the wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling, glass windows. 
<br><br>
	Debbie chose Bouillabaisse - soft shell crab, shrimp, clams, mussels and saffron-tomato broth.  I selected the Petite Romaine Caesar Salad to start. Then I went for the Two Crab Sandwich - warm Dungeness crab salad, fried soft shell crab, and root vegetable chips.  The latter were a little too hard for my taste. 
<br><br>
	The menu offers eight appetizers and thirteen entrees.  One of the appetizers, the Shellfish Platter, would make a fine entree. 
<br><br>
	Sutro’s seats about 170, and the Bistro seats as many, if not more. 
<br><br>
	There are two restrooms, side by side, each designated for men and women. There is a single ceramic commode and a metal washbasin in a marble counter in each, with a large mirror over the counter.  The floor is covered with large blue tiles, and the walls are covered with smaller tiles, some blue, some cream colored.

	Debbie and I went to Kokkari with John and Sue.
<br><br>
	You enter this restaurant at a far corner of a large dining room that turns out to be one of two large dining rooms.  The restaurant has a variety of private rooms that  can become part of the main restaurant. 
<br><br>
	To the far left is long bar with about 15 high chairs/stools.  Behind the bar is a large mirror with glass shelves holding a vast array of liquors and liqueurs.
<br><br>
	There are two large dining rooms hold an array of 2s, 4s, 6s, booths of four, and a community table that looks to seat about 20. The path to the community table is a bit circuitous.  There are also a number of private rooms, which can be opened for general restaurant seating.  All-in-all, the restaurant seats about 180 people. While the tables are relatively close to each other, they seemed to have been placed to allow for the greatest amount of private conversation.
<br><br>
	Each of the two main dining rooms has a large table which holds an endless amount of freshly baked bread and a carving station, so that servers can prepare an ample breadbasket for each table. 
<br><br>
	Sue and John started the meal with Fakes Supa - lentil, vegetable soup with braised greens.  For her main course, Sue had two appetizers: Octapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil, and Mapakia - wood oven-roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and Lemon.
<br><br>
	Debbie started her meal with Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing.  I had Pantzaria - roasted beets with Greek yogurt and pistachio.
<br><br>
	For her main course Debbie chose Rotisserie, slow roasted Napa Valley spring lamb served over roasted potatoes.  John and I selected slow roasted Goat shavings over Orzo Past, Feta, Tomato Sauce, and Artichoke.
<br><br>
	For dessert we ordered two, very large, hot fudge sundaes (skipping the whipped cream).
<br><br>
	Getting to the restrooms is a bit of an adventure.  From where we were seated in a corner booth on the outside wall of the first dining room, one has to work one’s way through both dining rooms and down a long hall, to reach an elevator that takes you to the area in which the restrooms are located. 
<br><br>
	The men's room had a single wall-attached white ceramic urinal and a fully enclosed commode room with a white ceramic commode.  There are two hand washing stations with dark wooden counters, sunken white ceramic washbasins, and appropriate mirrors.  The floor is dark brown and the walls are a light tan with a greenish hue.
<br><br>
	In chatting with our server, who was well informed about the menu and really quite delightful, we learned that she works 30 hours a week at the restaurant while attending college full-time.  What she earns at the restaurant, plus a grant from the state of California, will enable her to finish her schooling without student debt.  
<br><br>
	Reservations are necessary.  The night we were there, a Thursday, the entire restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7 p.m. and packed when we left around 9:30 p.m.

This restaurant is literally next door to <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/03/restaurant_quince_1.shtml">Quince</a>, and is owned and operated by Michael and Lindsay Lusk, who also own and run Quince.  Michael is the chef at both restaurants.  
<br><br>
Cotogna is much more casual and is described as an Italian trattoria.  I did not go in, but Dick reports that the restaurant is trendy and casual, with crowded tables.  Some say that it is harder to get a reservation there than at Quince.
<br><br>
	The difference between the two restaurants is demonstrated on its OpenTable entry. The price of a meal at Quince is described as $50 or more. At Cotogna it is described as $30 and under.

<em>(Note: On a recent trip I was able to enjoy meals at seven restaurants: Buckeye Roadhouse, Cliff House, Kokkari, Prospect, Quince, Sauce, and Serpentine. Reports on three of those restaurants are included in this issue.  The other four will be covered in the next issue.)</em>
<br><br>
I visited Quince at a previous location in the Spring of 2007.  <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2007/05/restaurant_quince.shtml">At the time I wrote</a>, “If this is not the single best restaurant at which we have ever eaten, it is certainly in the top two or three.”
<br><br>
	While the new location is somewhat fancier than the previous location, and one friend of ours complained that it was too fancy (although the person had not been there), it remains a perfect dining situation. 
<br><br>
	On this occasion we had dinner with Dick, and Murray joined us for dessert. 
<br><br>
	The foods are interesting, tasty, and served in creative ways. The service is something beyond impeccable without falling into the trap of over-fawning attention, which can quickly become a distraction. 
<br><br>
	Debbie started with Nantucket Bay Scallop Crudo – Oro Blanco Grapefruit, Radish and Pantelleria Caper.  Dick ordered Zuckerman’s Green Asparagus – Smoked egg yolk, Miner’s Lettuce and Hazelnut.  I opted for Smoked Rainbow Trout – Lovage, Pearl Onion and Dill.
<br><br>
	For her entrée Debbie went with Fagotelli – Phil Paine’s squab, Red Cabbage and Sunchoke.  Dick had Acquerello Carnaroli Risotto – Dungeness Crab, Brussels Sprout and Kaffir Lime.  I enjoyed John Dory – Little Gem Lettuce, Black Trumpet Mushroom and Prosecco.
<br><br>
	Dessert for Debbie was Pistachio Millefoglie – Honey Comb, Lemon Confit and Sicilian Pistachio Gelato.  Dick savored Chocolate Praline – Nocino Ice Cream and Full Belly Farm Walnut.
<br><br>
	Murray, who joined us in time for dessert and conversation, chose Selections From the Cheese Cart.	
<br><br>
	There are two unisex restrooms.  Dick, being a regular reader of Washington Watch, reported soon after coming back from the restroom that there was a large and beautiful orchid plant in the restroom.  About the unisex bathroom in the previous restaurant I wrote, “The unisex restroom is the narrowest I have ever encountered.  It can’t be more than 4 feet wide and about twice as long.  Yet even with its diminutive size, it is as elegant as the restaurant of which it is a part.”
<br><br>
	The restrooms in the new location are equally as elegant, but somewhat larger.  There are two sections of the room, separated by a floor-to-ceiling full wall that comes out about 3 feet from the back wall.  To the left is a circular white ceramic washbasin embedded in a marble top, beneath which is a closed storage area.  To the right is the white ceramic commode, which has some privacy from the sink.  The orchid is located on a dark wooden shelf which is to your left as you sit on the commode.  Good friends could be in the restroom at the same time; strangers might find it uncomfortable.  The floors are dark and the walls are a white/tan color. 
<br><br>
There is valet parking and reservations are a must.

<h1>Unum</h1>
2917 M Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20007<br>
202-621-6959<br>
<a href="http://http://unumdc.com">unumdc.com</a></div>I had dinner at Unum twice over three days.  The first evening was with Mary and Joe, and the second evening with Debbie, Maureen and Andy.  Happily, the second visit was a repeat of a very enjoyable first visit.  
<br><br>
	The restaurant is relatively small and has a pub-like quality.  Currently, it is only open for dinner.  It seats about 60 people, including about a dozen at the bar, which is to your left as you enter the relatively narrow restaurant.  The rest of the seating is at 2s and 4s.  The way the tables are organized they can create larger tables. 
<br><br>
	Mary started with the Unum salad -- petite oak & tango lettuce, endive, cherries, Asian & Bartlett pears and sherry vinaigrette; and then enjoyed the boneless short rib pasta -- tagliatelle noodles, baby root vegetables, red-wine braising jus.
<br><br>
	Joe opted for the beet salad -- raw, pickled & roasted beets, lemon-goat cheese & vanilla vinaigrette, followed by the cinnamon-pomegranate duck confit- - pearl cous cous, figs, Tuscan kale, toasted almonds, shallot puree, and pomegranate sauce.
<br><br>
	On that first evening, I ordered Unum rabbit terrine, Unum salad and the duck confit. 
<br><br>
	On the second evening, Maureen began with the beet salad and roasted organic chicken -- jus of olives, dried fruit, capers, with roasted fingerling potatoes. 
<br><br>
	Debbie also started with the beet salad, followed by the duck confit.
<br><br>
	Andy opted for the Unum salad and the duck confit.
<br><br>
	I started with the Unum chicken liver mousse, the beet salad, and the boneless short rib pasta. 
<br><br>
	The first evening ended without dessert.  On the second night, we shared chocolate & mint -- mint ice cream, chocolate cemeaux, butterscotch pudding, chocolate soil & pizzle, and assortment of three sorbets, including a goat cheese sorbet.	 
<br><br>
	One relatively unique, but desirable, feature of the menu is that half-portions can be ordered for five of the nine entrees, at half price.  I tried a half-order of the short rib pasta because the waiter suggested that I would find it more than ample. He was right.  
<br><br>
	Phil Blane, the chef owner (along with his wife Laurie Schiller), roams the restaurant, visiting with guests. 
<br><br>
	The restrooms are in the basement, down a flight of wooden stairs with part of the stone foundation showing.  The rest of the stairwell and hallway are painted red.  The men's restroom is small but of serviceable size.  There is a white ceramic commode and a square white ceramic wash basin in a counter.  The walls here are also red, except for the wall behind the commode, which is covered in large green tiles, as is the floor.
<br><br>
	Parking is on the street or in one of the lots within a few blocks.  If you make a 6:30 p.m. reservation you have a reasonable chance of being able to park on the street in front of the restaurant, on which parking is not allowed from 4-6:30 p.m.

3714 Macomb Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20016<br>
202-686-2015</div>Debbie and I were with Tom and Linda on our third visit to Le Zinc.  On our first visit many months ago, things were a little ragged, so I did not write about it. But the second and third visits were quite good, so it seems time to share our experience.
<br><br>
	The restaurant is fairly narrow.  On the main level, as you come in, there are tables of various sizes along the right hand wall and several tables to the left, starting about half way into the restaurant.  To the left there is a balcony several steps up, where there are additional tables which can be combined into a single table for a large group.
<br><br>
	Linda and Debbie started with the Goat Cheese Salad.  Tom opted for the Pear and Gorgonzola Salad, and I had the Classic French Onion Soup.
<br><br>
	For main courses, Debbie and Tom selected the Rockfish special.  Linda went with Mussels, and I savored Smoked Lancaster Chicken.
<br><br>
	For dessert we shared Crepes with Ice cream and Berries topped with Zabaglione sauce.
<br><br>
	The men's room is relatively small, but includes a white ceramic commode and a square white ceramic washbasin with rounded corners. The walls are red, and the floor is covered with very small mixed tiles.
<br><br>
	Parking is on the street.
<br><br>
	Lunch is served Tuesday through Friday, and dinner Tuesday through Sunday.

                                 80% disapprove of the job that the Congress is doing.  This is only slightly lower than the all-time high disapproval of Congress recorded in January 2012, when disapproval hit a high 84%.  [WP/ABC 3/13]  This level of disapproval is  confirmed in an early March Gallup survey, which found 83% expressing disapproval.
<br><br>
	62% of Americans disapprove of the job being done by Democrats in Congress.  72% disapprove of the job being done by Republicans in Congress.
<br><br>
	When asked for their view of Congress these days, 56% believe “the political system can work fine, it’s the members that are the problem.”  In an unusual level of agreement, 58% of Republicans, 57% of Democrats, and 56% of Independents hold that view.  [PEW 1/13]
<br><br>
	The polarization of the House and Senate are all but complete.  The chart below shows the number of Members of the House and Senate whose vote rating puts them between the most liberal Republican and the most Conservative Democrat.

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Democrats 53</li>
  <li> Republicans 45</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>

The question of the hour is whether Republicans can win six Senate seats in the 2014 election and regain control of the Senate.  On today’s facts it is not likely, but it is a long time until November 2014.   Mid-term elections tend to favor the Party that does not hold the Presidency.   Most of the seats up this year were last contested in 2008, a strong Democratic year in which Obama and his campaign provided a lot of wind at the back of Democratic candidates.  
<br><br>
	Six of the current Democratic Senators are not running for re-election.  Two Republican Senators are not standing for re-election.
<br><br>
	The impact of the fully engaged Super PACs and related organizations have not been felt in a mid-term election as yet. 
<br><br>
	It remains to be seen whether the Republican Party can avoid nominating out-of-step candidates.  That phenomenon likely caused the loss of one Senate election in 2012, and probably two.
<br><br>
	There are 35 Senate seats up in 2014, and once again the Democrats have a substantially larger number of seats to defend (21) than do the Republicans (14). 
<br><br>
	In Nate Silver’s initial review of the races the Democrats end up holding the Senate with 50.4% of the seats.

It is worth remembering that U.S. Senators represent the people within a geographic boundary, but do not represent a proportional number of Americans, as do Members of the House of Representatives.
<br><br>

62 Senators represent roughly one-fourth of the nation’s population
<br><br>
<ul>
		<li> 30 of the Senators are Republicans</li>
		<li> 30 of the Senators are Democrats</li>
		<li> 2 of the Senators are Independents</li>
</ul>

	32 Senators represent roughly half of the nation’s population
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 13 of the Senators are Republicans</li>
<li> 19 of the Senators are Democrats</li>
</ul>

	  6 Senators represent one-quarter of the nation’s population
	<br><br>  
<ul>
<li> 2 of the Senators are Republican</li>
<li> 4 of the Senators are Democrats</li>
</ul>

<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">


<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

Of course, the Democrats are talking about taking back the House.  All it takes is holding all of their current seats and taking back 17 from the Republicans.  
<br><br>

There have been swings in House elections large enough to climb the hill facing the Democrats; however, those large swings have all benefited the Party not in the White House.
<br><br>
	There has been no election in more than 150 years in which the Party controlling the White House gained even as many as 10 seats. 
<br><br>
President Obama seems determined to help in House elections well beyond anything he has done in the past.  It remains to be seen how popular he will be in the fall of 2014, and whether whatever his level of popularity can be transferred to various House candidates around the country. 
<br><br>
<strong>The U.S. House of Representatives</strong>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Republicans 233</li>
<li> Democrats    200</li>
<li> Vacancies	       2</li>
</ul>

As it has for a very long time, WW regularly reprints and relies on the analysis of House Races published by the “Cook Political Report.”

54% disagree with Obama on the issues that mean the most to them.  This is the highest level of disagreement since 55% expressed that sentiment in October 2010.  [CNN/ORC 3/13]
<br><br>
	In February the NBC/WSJ survey found 51% disapproving of Obama’s performance on the economy.  A month later 52% had the same view. 
<br><br>
	In March the public trusted Obama, rather than the Republicans in Congress, to do a better job of handling the economy (44% to 40%); handling immigration issues (45% to 39%); and handling gun control (42% to 41%).  [WP/ABC 3/13]
<br><br>
	Positive feelings toward President Obama have dropped by 17 points over the last four years, and negative feelings have grown by 26 points.  There has been little change in either measure over the last two years.

<p id="state-of-play">It was May 17, 2004, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a Monday like many other Mondays, except for one thing.<br>
The night before, lines began to form in front of the Cambridge City Hall.  At 12:01 a.m., for the first time, at any place in America, gay and lesbian couples could fill out a form entitled “Notice of Intent to Marry.”  While there was a three- day waiting period between the filing of the notice and the issuance of a marriage license,  the waiting period was waived for a number of couples and they were married on that day. 
<br><br>
When talking about that day at dinner a few nights ago, my friend Mary Breslauer’s eyes lit up and she smiled.  Mary was part of the group that led the effort to arrive at that moment. 
<br><br>
[Note: Ten years earlier, in 1993, the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled that the State could not deny gay people the right to marry each other.  The right was taken away in 1998 when the voters enacted a State constitutional ban on
same-sex marriage.
<br><br>
Vermont was the first State to enact civil unions, in 2000.  But, as I learned a number of years ago from Mary, civil unions, by whatever name, are not the same as marriage. ]
<br><br>
The decade that followed that morning in Massachusetts was the turning point.
<br><br>
It took another four and a half years after Massachusetts issued its first marriage license for Connecticut to become the second State to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples, on November 17, 2008.  Since then seven additional States and the District of Columbia have begun issuing marriage licenses.

*  These States have amendments to their State constitutions that ban same-sex <strong>marriage</strong>.
<br><br>
One State, Wisconsin, has enacted a limited civil union provision.
<br><br>
 Two States, New Mexico (by opinion of its attorney general) and Rhode Island (by executive order of its governor), recognize same-sex marriages from States in which they are lawful. 
<br><br>
But all is not roses.  Thirty-eight States have anti-marriage constitutional amendments or statutes prohibiting same-sex marriages (including some of those which have enacted civil unions).

<h2 id="the-supreme-court">The Supreme Court</h2>

Earlier this week, the United States Supreme Court heard two cases that are very much a part of the continuing effort to expand the availability of same-sex marriage. 
<br><br>
One case involves the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which by its terms deprives even those same-sex couples who are legally married in one State with access to Federal benefits.  The second case deals with the Constitutionality of a California referendum which overturned a California Supreme Court decision that the right of marriage could not be denied to same-sex couples.
<br><br>
Rather than attempt to explain these two cases, WW asked its favorite Federal appellate lawyer, Andy Pincus, to lay out the cases in a way that they can be understood by non-lawyers and fallen-away lawyers.
<br><br>
This week’s oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the two “gay marriage” cases have captured at least as much media attention as last year’s “Obamacare” case – and maybe more. But the particular legal issues in each case, and the ways that the Court might resolve them, have received relatively less focus.  Following is a summary – for non-lawyers – of the questions before the Court in each case.
<br><br>
<strong><em>United States v. Windsor</em>: the federal Defense of Marriage Act</strong>
<br><br>
An individual’s rights under more than 1,000 federal laws and regulations depend upon whether he or she is lawfully married – income tax rates, immigration rules, and Social Security survivors’ benefits are just a few examples.  Prior to 1996, federal law simply incorporated state law definitions of marriage – if individuals had entered into a valid marriage under state law, they were married for purposes of these federal laws as well.  
<br><br>
The Defense of Marriage Act (universally known as “DOMA”) changed that standard, providing that for purposes of federal laws and regulations “the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word `spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.”  Even if a same-sex marriage is valid under state law, DOMA provides that the parties to that marriage are not spouses for purposes of any of these 1,000 federal laws and regulations.
<br><br>
Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer were married in Canada in 2007.  When Thea Spyer died, she left her estate to Edith Windsor, which triggered an obligation to pay more than $363,000 in federal estate taxes – federal law provides that a surviving spouse’s inheritance from the deceased spouse generally is not taxed, but because of DOMA that exclusion did not apply to Spyer’s bequest to Windsor.  Windsor, as executor of her spouse’s estate, filed suit to recover the taxes, claiming that DOMA’s exclusion of same-sex marriages from the federal definition of “marriage” violates the Constitution.  Both the federal district court and the federal court of appeals ruled that DOMA is unconstitutional.
<br><br>
The Supreme Court first must decide whether it has the power to resolve this constitutional question.  Federal courts are limited to deciding “cases and controversies.”  That means, among other things, that the party invoking a court’s jurisdiction must have suffered an “actual injury” that provides “standing to sue.”  
<br><br>
Ordinarily, the federal government defends the constitutionality of federal statutes and the legal dispute between the federal government and the party challenging the statute satisfies the case-and-controversy requirement. Here, however, Windsor and the federal government agree that DOMA is unconstitutional.  Does that mean there is no “controversy” for a court to resolve?  The federal government and Windsor argue that the President’s determination that federal agencies must comply with DOMA unless a court directs otherwise demonstrates the continued existence of the necessary controversy, and some prior Supreme Court decisions support that argument.
<br><br>
DOMA’s constitutionality is being defended by the “Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives” (known as “BLAG”), which is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats (the Democrats oppose BLAG’s defense of the statute).  BLAG’s participation could provide the needed case-or-controversy, but the Supreme Court has been skeptical of congressional “standing” in a number of past cases.  BLAG’s presence in the lawsuit therefore may not remedy any standing deficiency.
<br><br>
The consequences of a ruling that the Court cannot hear the case would be significant: same-sex spouses would have to continue to bring their own lawsuits in order to obtain the federal rights available to other spouses.  Unless a court of appeals held DOMA constitutional (and no court of appeals has reached that conclusion thus far), the Supreme Court could never issue a conclusive decision on the issue. 
 <br><br>
Assuming that the Supreme Court finds that it has the power to resolve the merits of the constitutional question, it will determine whether DOMA deprives spouses in state-recognized same-sex marriages of the equal protection of the laws.  A key question in equal protection analysis is the extent of the burden on the government to justify the distinction drawn by the challenged law.  Most legislative classifications need only a “rational basis”; categorizations based on race, on the other hand, are subject to “strict scrutiny” and must be justified by a compelling governmental interest.  Distinctions based on gender receive “heightened scrutiny” – requiring that they are “substantially related to an important governmental objective.”
<br><br>
The Supreme Court could determine that classifications based on sexual orientation, like the one in DOMA, must be justified by heightened scrutiny, a ruling that would make it easier to invalidate other laws that discriminate on this basis.  Or it could conclude that only a rational justification is needed.
<br><br>
Importantly, a decision that the rational basis test applies does not mean that DOMA would survive.  Several courts have held there is no rational justification for DOMA’s distinction between state-recognized opposite-sex marriages and state-recognized same-sex marriages.  Indeed, because the definition of marriage is an area in which the states are accorded broad authority, some of the Justices who are supportive of states’ rights – such as Justice Kennedy – may conclude that DOMA can be upheld only if there is some significant federal interest in overriding states’ decisions to recognize same-sex marriages.  The Court could therefore invalidate DOMA without deciding that other types of laws discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny.
<br><br>
<strong><em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em>:  California’s Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage</strong>
<br><br>
The California Supreme Court in May 2008 invalidated a state law that restricted marriage to opposite-sex couples.  Sixth months later California voters approved a ballot initiative – Proposition 8 – that amended the California Constitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”  Two same-sex couples who wish to marry filed a lawsuit in federal court asserting that Proposition 8 violates the equal protection guarantee of the United States Constitution.  
<br><br>
The California officials named as defendants (including the Governor and Attorney General) declined to defend the constitutionality of Proposition 8.  The individuals who proposed Proposition 8, and were designated as its official proponents, joined the lawsuit to defend the measure’s constitutionality.  Following a trial, the federal district court held Proposition 8 unconstitutional and the court of appeals agreed. 
<br><br>
In this case too there is a question about whether the Supreme Court has the power to decide the constitutional question.  The issue here is whether the proponents of a ballot initiative have a legal interest in the measure’s constitutionality sufficient to create the required “case-or-controversy.”  Although the California courts have said that <em>state law</em> gives the proponents an interest in defending the measure’s constitutionality, it is not clear that this state-law interest is concrete enough to satisfy the <em>federal law</em> case-or-controversy requirement.  Many observers believe that the chances are significant that the Court will find a lack of “standing” and decline to address the merits of the constitutional question in <em>Hollingsworth</em>.  (In contrast to the federal government’s position in <em>Windsor</em>, California did not seek or support Supreme Court review of the constitutional question.)
<br><br>
If the Court does reach the merits, it will face the same question discussed above regarding the equal protection standard that should apply.  Again, a heightened scrutiny standard is more likely to lead to invalidation of Proposition 8’s ban on same-sex marriage.  But even under a rational basis test, there remains the possibility that Proposition 8 could be invalidated.  
<br><br>
The Court could issue a broad ruling that would invalidate all same-sex marriage bans.  But several arguments have been advanced that would enable the Court to issue a ruling that would not apply nationwide, but rather would be tied to particular facts present in California.  First, California initially recognized same-sex marriage and then changed its law to ban same-sex marriage.  The Court could conclude that the elimination of a previously-recognized right requires special justification that is not present in this case – a rationale that would apply only to California.
<br><br>
Second, California’s civil union law provides same-sex couples with all of the legal rights of married couples and, in addition, California permits same-sex couples to adopt children.  But California refuses to extend the designation “marriage” to those same-sex couples.  The Court could conclude that in these circumstances there is no government interest that justifies depriving same-sex couples of the benefits of the “marriage” designation. (This argument, if accepted by the Court, would likely apply to eight other states that have civil union laws similar to California’s.)
 <br><br>
Of course, the Court could uphold Proposition 8 and reject the constitutional challenge, which likely would erect a significant obstacle to challenging other same-sex marriage bans on equal protection grounds.   
<br><br>
Although the legal arguments advanced in <em>Hollingsworth</em> are of course important, perhaps more significant in the long term are some of the friend-of-the-court briefs that have been filed urging the Supreme Court to invalidate bans on same-sex marriage.  One was filed by more than 100 Republicans, led by former Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman.  Another was filed by dozens of businesses.  And still another by religious organizations.  Whatever decision the Court renders, these briefs provide concrete evidence of the dramatic societal shift on the marriage issue, a shift that will influence the Court but that will have its greatest and most far-reaching effects outside the Court.

<h2 id="one-more-milestone">One more milestone in the decade</h2>

In 1993, President Bill Clinton’s attempt to fulfill his campaign promise to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military resulted in the establishment of  the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.”  Gays and lesbians could serve as long as no one knew about their sexual orientation.
<br><br>
Presidential candidate Barack Obama called for a full repeal of the law  during his 2008 campaign.  In December 2010, the law was repealed. 
<br><br>
Beginning on September 20, 2011, gays and lesbians could serve openly in the United States military.
