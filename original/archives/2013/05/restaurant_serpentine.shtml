San Francisco, CA 94197<br>

<a href="http://www.serpentinesf.com">www.serpentinesf.com</a></div>Debbie and I went with Dee and Elroy to this restaurant in the Dogpatch section of San Francisco.
<br><br>
The restaurant is located in an old industrial section of town which is going through a kind of rebirth. The inside of the restaurant can also best be described as industrial. As you enter, there is a bar with about 10 high stools at which the regular menu is served, as well as those things you usually find at a bar. Overall, the restaurant is relatively small, and seats about 70 people at high tables, regular height tables and booths.
<br><br>
We were there for brunch, which is offered on Saturdays and Sundays.
<br><br>
Dee ordered the red flannel hash - beef brisket, crispy potatoes, roasted beets, arugula, horseradish crème Fraiche, poached eggs & grilled levain (bread).
<br><br>
Debbie selected local Dungeness crab Benedict - two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, sautéed spinach, fried capers and lemon, fines herbes, buttermilk biscuit and crispy potatoes.
<br><br>
Dee and Debbie shared the two dishes.
<br><br>
Elroy went for baked eggs -- two eggs, spiced garbanzo beans, Swiss chard, hen of the woods mushrooms, tomatillo green salsa, toasted levain, and pork sausage.
<br><br>
I selected the fried egg sandwich - Ledbetter's English muffin, fried eggs (yolks removed), arugula, dill aioli crispy potatoes, and a fruit salad.
<br><br>
Our server was Sarah, who was friendly and accommodating.
<br><br>
Because the restaurant is so small, the women's and men's restrooms are literally in the dining room. In order to mask them, two small structures have been built into the dining room, with a heavy drape covering the opening. It is that drape that is seen when you are in the dining room. It results in a 3-foot anteroom before you actually get to the restroom doors.
<br><br>
The restroom itself is small, but not overbearingly so. It houses a commode and a washbasin, both of which are white ceramic, and a wood chair in one corner. The walls are painted dark red, and the floor is covered in a bluish linoleum. It is clean and serviceable.
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, and the only parking is on the street. We ended up parking a good block from the restaurant.
