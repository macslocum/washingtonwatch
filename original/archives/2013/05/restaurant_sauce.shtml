<h1>sauce</h1>
131-135 Gough Street<br>
San Francisco, CA 94102<br>
415-252-1423</div>Debbie and I went with Julia to “sauce” for dinner. This is a somewhat unusual restaurant in that it has an eight-room guest house in which you can rent a single room or any combination, up to eight.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant you are in the bar area, which has six high stools and several high round tables with stools. To the left is a dining room that seats up to 40 people in combinations of 2, 4 and 6 seats. If you go back into and through the bar area, you come to a second dining room with its own bar. It has a neon sign over the hallway that announces the "sauce night club." It seats 34 people, including a number of 6s. On this particular evening the back dining room was empty.
<br><br>
The atmosphere is of an old neighborhood pub.
<br><br>
We started by sharing an order of Dungeness Crab Wontons - cream cheese, cilantro, green & red onion, gingered apple sweet and sour sauce.
<br><br>
Julia started with Braised Beef Sweet Gem Salad Cups - house burrata, basil roasted tomato garlic and shallot. Debbie and Mike selected the Baby Iceberg Wedge Salad - lettuce bowl filled with Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roma Tomato, Red & Green Onion & Ranch topped with Crispy Bacon. (Iceberg Wedge salads are my favorite and this was the single best I have ever eaten.)
<br><br>
Julia's entree was Roasted Artichoke & Spinach Ravioli - Cremini Mushrooms, Fresh Mozzarella, Beet Tops, Kale, San Marzano Tomatoes, Fresh Herb and Reggiano.
<br><br>
Debbie went with an appetizer as her main course: Horseradish Crusted Shrimp - San Marzano Tomato Cocktail Sauce, Fresh Horseradish.
<br><br>
I opted for sauce's Fried Chicken - Breast & Wing w/Truffled Mushrooms & Green Beans, Whipped Potato & Pan Gravy.
<br><br>
For dessert we shared a Sauce Ice Cream Smash, a sundae of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce laced with whiskey, and a fresh-from-the-oven pear cobbler with vanilla ice cream.
<br><br>
There are two unisex restrooms. They would be classified as small, but neat. There is a single white ceramic commode, a small triangular white ceramic washbasin attached to the wall in a corner, red wall coloring, and a large framed mirror on each wall from waist to ceiling.
<br><br>
The service was excellent; fully attentive, but not clinging. 
<br><br>
Parking is on the street.
