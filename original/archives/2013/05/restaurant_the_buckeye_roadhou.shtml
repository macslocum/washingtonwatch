We met Suzy and Bill at the Buckeye, which is about a 45 minute drive from downtown San Francisco.
<br><br>
To the right, as you enter, there is a bar area, which includes a long bar and a number of booths and tables. The dinner menu is also available in this area.
<br><br>
To the left is a good-sized dining room, including tables of 2, 4, 6 and at least one 8. There is an additional dining room located on a balcony overlooking the main floor level dining room.
<br><br>
This is clearly a neighborhood restaurant. Dress is primarily casual to very casual, and the diners include young children and babies.
<br><br>
To begin we shared a large serving of the thinnest onion rings I had ever seen, but they were good.
<br><br>
Suzy selected as an appetizer, Dino Kale - Ricotta Salata, Shaved Fennel, Black Radish, Bread Crumbs. Debbie picked Organic Butter Lettuce - Spiced Walnuts, Fuji Apple, Point Reyes Blue Cheese. I again chose The Wedge - Iceberg Lettuce, Zoe Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese. Bill passed on the first course.
<br><br>
For her Entree, Suzy decided on Seared Sesame Sprinkle Ahi Tuna - Red and Napa Cabbage, Crispy Wonton, Hoisin-Ginger Vinaigrette. She did also savor one of Bill's Ribs.
<br><br>
Debbie went back and forth, but finally chose Saut√©ed Calf's Liver - Zoe's Bacon, Caramelized Onions, Garlic Potatoes.
<br><br>
Bill, who eats beef only once or twice a year, opted for Barbecued Baby Back Ribs - Maple Mashed Yams, Cole Slaw. I chose Braised Lamb Shank "Gremolata" - Saffron Couscous, Pine Nuts.
<br><br>
We were all too full to try the desserts.
<br><br>
The men's room has a single large urinal and a single washbasin in a marble counter directly across from the urinal. There is a commode area that is walled off, but open for a foot or so at the bottom. The walls and the floor are covered with green tiles of various sizes.
<br><br>
Melanie and Eliot love this restaurant.
