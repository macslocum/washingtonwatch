[Note: In the usual course, Washington Watch does not include discussion of books. However, I had an opportunity to read an early draft of “Stiletto Network” and I found it intriguing. I asked the author, Pamela Ryckman, to send me a paragraph or two describing her book. I was given the opportunity to write a blurb for the book jacket, which follows Ryckman’s description.]
<br><br>
“<strong><em>STILETTO NETWORK</em></strong> is a story of female friendship – disguised as a business story, a tale of women banding together to improve lives and companies and communities, to realize their dreams and change the world. During the past few years, women’s groups have been coalescing in every major American city. Formidable ladies across industries are convening at unprecedented rates; they're creating salons and dinner groups; and collaborating not only to achieve clout and success, but also to create a more just and equal society. Each group has no more than 10 women, but in aggregate they number in the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of women nationwide.
<br><br>
A new girls' network is alive and set to hyper-drive, and <em>STILETTO NETWORK</em> is the first book to shed light on this groundbreaking movement.”
<br><br>
Here is the blurb that I wrote:
<br><br>
“Pamela Ryckman uses good old-fashioned storytelling to illuminate a moment in history where women are poised to make waves in business, politics, and philanthropy. An important read for men who want to know where the world is heading and want to understand the change (without feeling under attack).”
<br><br>
The book will be published on May 16, but can be ordered on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stiletto-Network-Circles-Changing-Business/dp/0814432530/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1367667916&sr=8-1&keywords=stilleto+network">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/stiletto-network-pamela-ryckman/1114065732?ean=9780814432532">Barnes & Noble</a>, or <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780814432532">IndieBound</a>.
