<h1>Serpentine</h1>
2495 Third Street<br>
San Francisco, CA 94197<br>
415-252-2000<br>
<a href="http://www.serpentinesf.com">www.serpentinesf.com</a></div>Debbie and I went with Dee and Elroy to this restaurant in the Dogpatch section of San Francisco.
<br><br>
The restaurant is located in an old industrial section of town which is going through a kind of rebirth. The inside of the restaurant can also best be described as industrial. As you enter, there is a bar with about 10 high stools at which the regular menu is served, as well as those things you usually find at a bar. Overall, the restaurant is relatively small, and seats about 70 people at high tables, regular height tables and booths.
<br><br>
We were there for brunch, which is offered on Saturdays and Sundays.
<br><br>
Dee ordered the red flannel hash - beef brisket, crispy potatoes, roasted beets, arugula, horseradish crème Fraiche, poached eggs & grilled levain (bread).
<br><br>
Debbie selected local Dungeness crab Benedict - two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, sautéed spinach, fried capers and lemon, fines herbes, buttermilk biscuit and crispy potatoes.
<br><br>
Dee and Debbie shared the two dishes.
<br><br>
Elroy went for baked eggs -- two eggs, spiced garbanzo beans, Swiss chard, hen of the woods mushrooms, tomatillo green salsa, toasted levain, and pork sausage.
<br><br>
I selected the fried egg sandwich - Ledbetter's English muffin, fried eggs (yolks removed), arugula, dill aioli crispy potatoes, and a fruit salad.
<br><br>
Our server was Sarah, who was friendly and accommodating.
<br><br>
Because the restaurant is so small, the women's and men's restrooms are literally in the dining room. In order to mask them, two small structures have been built into the dining room, with a heavy drape covering the opening. It is that drape that is seen when you are in the dining room. It results in a 3-foot anteroom before you actually get to the restroom doors.
<br><br>
The restroom itself is small, but not overbearingly so. It houses a commode and a washbasin, both of which are white ceramic, and a wood chair in one corner. The walls are painted dark red, and the floor is covered in a bluish linoleum. It is clean and serviceable.
<br><br>
Reservations are recommended, and the only parking is on the street. We ended up parking a good block from the restaurant.

<h1>sauce</h1>
131-135 Gough Street<br>
San Francisco, CA 94102<br>
415-252-1423</div>Debbie and I went with Julia to “sauce” for dinner. This is a somewhat unusual restaurant in that it has an eight-room guest house in which you can rent a single room or any combination, up to eight.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant you are in the bar area, which has six high stools and several high round tables with stools. To the left is a dining room that seats up to 40 people in combinations of 2, 4 and 6 seats. If you go back into and through the bar area, you come to a second dining room with its own bar. It has a neon sign over the hallway that announces the "sauce night club." It seats 34 people, including a number of 6s. On this particular evening the back dining room was empty.
<br><br>
The atmosphere is of an old neighborhood pub.
<br><br>
We started by sharing an order of Dungeness Crab Wontons - cream cheese, cilantro, green & red onion, gingered apple sweet and sour sauce.
<br><br>
Julia started with Braised Beef Sweet Gem Salad Cups - house burrata, basil roasted tomato garlic and shallot. Debbie and Mike selected the Baby Iceberg Wedge Salad - lettuce bowl filled with Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roma Tomato, Red & Green Onion & Ranch topped with Crispy Bacon. (Iceberg Wedge salads are my favorite and this was the single best I have ever eaten.)
<br><br>
Julia's entree was Roasted Artichoke & Spinach Ravioli - Cremini Mushrooms, Fresh Mozzarella, Beet Tops, Kale, San Marzano Tomatoes, Fresh Herb and Reggiano.
<br><br>
Debbie went with an appetizer as her main course: Horseradish Crusted Shrimp - San Marzano Tomato Cocktail Sauce, Fresh Horseradish.
<br><br>
I opted for sauce's Fried Chicken - Breast & Wing w/Truffled Mushrooms & Green Beans, Whipped Potato & Pan Gravy.
<br><br>
For dessert we shared a Sauce Ice Cream Smash, a sundae of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce laced with whiskey, and a fresh-from-the-oven pear cobbler with vanilla ice cream.
<br><br>
There are two unisex restrooms. They would be classified as small, but neat. There is a single white ceramic commode, a small triangular white ceramic washbasin attached to the wall in a corner, red wall coloring, and a large framed mirror on each wall from waist to ceiling.
<br><br>
The service was excellent; fully attentive, but not clinging. 
<br><br>
Parking is on the street.

<h1>The Buckeye Roadhouse</h1>
15 Shoreline Highway<br>
Mill Valley, CA 94941<br>
415-331-2600</div>
We met Suzy and Bill at the Buckeye, which is about a 45 minute drive from downtown San Francisco.
<br><br>
To the right, as you enter, there is a bar area, which includes a long bar and a number of booths and tables. The dinner menu is also available in this area.
<br><br>
To the left is a good-sized dining room, including tables of 2, 4, 6 and at least one 8. There is an additional dining room located on a balcony overlooking the main floor level dining room.
<br><br>
This is clearly a neighborhood restaurant. Dress is primarily casual to very casual, and the diners include young children and babies.
<br><br>
To begin we shared a large serving of the thinnest onion rings I had ever seen, but they were good.
<br><br>
Suzy selected as an appetizer, Dino Kale - Ricotta Salata, Shaved Fennel, Black Radish, Bread Crumbs. Debbie picked Organic Butter Lettuce - Spiced Walnuts, Fuji Apple, Point Reyes Blue Cheese. I again chose The Wedge - Iceberg Lettuce, Zoe Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese. Bill passed on the first course.
<br><br>
For her Entree, Suzy decided on Seared Sesame Sprinkle Ahi Tuna - Red and Napa Cabbage, Crispy Wonton, Hoisin-Ginger Vinaigrette. She did also savor one of Bill's Ribs.
<br><br>
Debbie went back and forth, but finally chose Sautéed Calf's Liver - Zoe's Bacon, Caramelized Onions, Garlic Potatoes.
<br><br>
Bill, who eats beef only once or twice a year, opted for Barbecued Baby Back Ribs - Maple Mashed Yams, Cole Slaw. I chose Braised Lamb Shank "Gremolata" - Saffron Couscous, Pine Nuts.
<br><br>
We were all too full to try the desserts.
<br><br>
The men's room has a single large urinal and a single washbasin in a marble counter directly across from the urinal. There is a commode area that is walled off, but open for a foot or so at the bottom. The walls and the floor are covered with green tiles of various sizes.
<br><br>
Melanie and Eliot love this restaurant.

<a href="mailto:nfo@prospectsf.com">info@prospectsf.com</a></div>Peggy and Mike took Debbie and me to this restaurant. As a gesture to environmental consciousness, the menu for the evening we were there was printed on the back side of the menu from the night before.
<br><br>
As you enter the modern-appointed restaurant there is a large three-sided bar with some tables around the edges. It turns out there is a Happy Hour from 4-6 p.m. on Friday. We arrived a short time after that period was over, but the whole front of the restaurant was teeming and noisy ,which carried over to the back of the restaurant, until the bar crowd disappeared and the noise level softened.
<br><br>
There is an additional private room suitable for a reception or dinner, down a corridor and roughly across from the restrooms.
<br><br>
For starters - Peggy chose Hawaiian Kampachi Crudo - Golden Enoki, Shitake, Ginger, Sesame, Yuzu, Shiso and Radish.
<br><br>
Debbie selected Nantucket Bay Scallops - Vialone Nano Rissotto, Broccoli Romanesco, Ginger, Extra Virgin Olive Oil (these were the tiny scallops which are often so hard to find).
<br><br>
Mike and Mike enjoyed Hand Picked Dungeness Crab Salad - Brokaw Farm Avocado, Hearts of Palm, Citrus Supremes, Petite Greens.
<br><br>
For her entree Peggy opted for Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette- Panzanella of Asparagus, Various Peas & Bresaola, Spring Alliums, Bloomsdale Spinach, Caramelized Onions, Beef Jus.
<br><br>
Debbie went with Prather Ranch Berkshire Pork - Rose Fingerling Potatoes, Rutabaga & Apple Puree, Rye Whiskey Roasted Pear Hazelnut, Crispy Rye, Lardo & Sage, Port Jus.
<br><br>
The other Mike selected Brandt Farm Prime Ribeye - Pommes Frites, Bloomsdale Spinach, Marrow Bone, Gremolata, Beef Jus.
<br><br>
I had Liberty Valley Duck Breast - Breast & Crispy Rye, Black Quinoa, Rhubarb, Rainbow Chard, Quinoa & Walnut Brittle, Duck Jus.
<br><br>
For dessert. Peggy had a Lemon Meringue Sundae; Debbie savored Strawberry Rhubarb Crepes; the other Mike had Chocolate Cake; and I enjoyed Grapefruit Champagne Basil Sorbet.
<br><br>
Darcey was our server and she was on top of her game.
<br><br>
The men's room is on the dark side as a result of the dark walls and large brown-tiled floor. As you enter, there are two large white ceramic, wall-attached urinals with a floor to head top divider between them. Straight ahead is an enclosed commode area with dark paneling and door that starts about a foot from the floor. (The inside was not observable.) On the right is a long stone wash basin that has a V-shaped inner area. There are three separate sets of faucets.
<br><br>
There is valet parking.

Range is another new D.C. restaurant which opened just over four months ago. I went to Range with Debbie, Gail and Rob.
<br><br>
It is a massive (seats 300) modern restaurant that wraps around a large part of the atrium of the office building in which it is located. (Originally a series of separate retail stores were located around the atrium.) The restaurant is open to the atrium through floor to ceiling windows. Periodically during dinner, one is entertained by a series of light designs emanating from the atrium.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, off to the right is a glass-walled area in which a variety of cooking utensils and devices are offered for sale. To the left is the first of a variety of food stations; this one is set up to prepare candies and desserts. Wrapped around a goodly portion of the restaurant’s outer wall are a series of other stations, including cheeses, baked goods, a raw bar, rotisseries, a wood-fired hearth, and a coffee bar. There is also a counter than runs past each of the stations which seats over 50 people.
<br><br>
A separate bar area has high stools and a glass-walled private room that appears to seat up to twenty people.
<br><br>
There are a variety of tables and booths seating two or four people. There are also rounds that seem to seat up to six. One of the interesting features is that the 4 person booths are open on both sides. The tables can easily be shifted to the left or right, until everyone is seated comfortably, and then pulled back to a center position between all four diners.
<br><br>
The main outside entrance to Range is on Military Road. If you find the stairs leading up to the main entrance daunting, walk to your right, enter the Embassy Suites Hotel, and take the elevator on the left to the second floor.

When reviews of restaurants are written they are almost always about the chefs. The chefs create the food and that is what restaurants are all about. However, there is more to running a restaurant than cooking and presenting the food. If a chef is involved in more than one restaurant, all of them are treated as his or hers.
<br><br>
There are times when the ideas for a restaurant come from a non-chef. As it turns out, the original driving force behind Fredricks Volt, Lunchbox and Family Meal, Graffiato, and Range in D.C. is a non-chef, Hilda Staples. Staples was previously involved in public relations and is a mother of 7 year-old twins. Of course, once she decided to venture into the restaurant world, she teamed up with high quality, experienced chefs.
<br><br>
An article in the Local Living Section of the Washington Post on April 18th tells the story of Staples and the restaurants are described at length. The author of the article, Mari-Jane Williams, writes, “Staples does the behind the scenes work of running the businesses.” It is worth going online to <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-17/lifestyle/38605049_1_bryan-voltaggio-hilda-staples-family-meal">read the whole story</a>.

[Note: Subsequent to writing the piece below about The Grill Room, two separate couples who eat out regularly (one of whom went to The Grill Room at my suggestion) experienced significant service problems. It is as if the restaurant is unable to find experienced serving people and the communication with the kitchen is not quite ready for primetime.]
<br><br>
I was introduced to lunch at the Grill Room for lunch by Carol M., and subsequently Debbie and I had dinner there.
<br><br>
The Grill Room and the Capella Hotel have been open for only a few months. (The Hotel is in a converted office building, and has 49 rooms and suites that begin at about $650 per night.)
<br><br>
The hotel is located on the C & O Canal. The Grill Room is located on the canal side of the hotel and has floor to ceiling windows overlooking the water. There is an outdoor patio located right at the edge of the canal, which will be especially enjoyable on a warm night.
<br><br>
There are about 75 seats in the indoor portion of the restaurant. Included is a glass-enclosed private dining room that seats ten. The balance of the room is a combination of 2s, 4s (which can be shifted to accommodate larger parties), and one round table for six. Seating on the back wall is on a banquette. If arranging for a larger party and not using the private room, request space other than at the banquette. At a table of more than four, those sitting on the banquette have to inconvenience one or more parties if there is a need to leave the table before the meal is completed.
<br><br>
The patio has a half dozen 2s that can be shifted to make tables of four.
<br><br>
At lunch, Carol ordered two items from the Starters and Salads section of the menu; Baby Romaine Salad - Mizuna Leaf, Rotisserie Chicken, Caesar Dressing, Shave Wisconsin Parmesan and Chesapeake Jumbo Lump Crab Cake – Old Bay & Bacon mayonnaise. Carol also ordered Crème Brulee in an egg shell, a rather unique form of presentation. The egg shell was silver suggesting to me that it was not a real egg shell. We learned that real egg shells are painted offsite and then used for this dessert.
<br><br>
I ordered the Chopped Lobster Salad – Seasonal Greens & Vegetables, Pink Grapefruit Dressing and Onion rings.
<br><br>
At dinner Debbie also ordered two items from the Starter section of the menu. First she had the Chopped Lobster Salad – Seasonal Greens & Vegetables, Pink Grapefruit Dressing, followed by Jumbo Lump Crab Cake – Old Bay & Bacon Mayonnaise.
<br><br>
I started with Spring Pea Soup – Local Radishes & Smoked Eel, followed by Roasted Halibut – Roasted on the Bone with Sorrel & Oxtail Rice. We also ordered Onion Rings and Yukon Gold Creamed Truffle Potatoes.
<br><br>
One small issue was the fact that the onion rings I ordered at lunch were different than the onion rings I ordered at dinner, although there was nothing in the menu to suggest they might be different. The luncheon rings were single rings cooked in light oil. The dinner rings were of the more traditional deep fried variety.
<br><br>
The restaurant has a special style. I have had flowers delivered to many restaurants around Washington for my luncheon guests. Invariably they are placed on the table in the box in which they are delivered. At the Grill Room the top of the box was removed and the flowers were presented open to my guest. They were then recovered and made available when we left.
<br><br>
Service is still evolving. It ranges from very attentive to a bit forgetful.
<br><br>
The chef is from Sweden and has worked in a variety of Capella Hotel dining rooms around the world.
<br><br>
The walls and floor of the men’s room are covered with very large dark tiles, streaked with tan and white streaks and slashes. The marble countertop is of a similar style. There are two ceramic wash basins in the countertop. There are round mirrors over each wash basin, each circled by a light all the way around the mirror. There are two circular wall-hanging urinals, with floor to ceiling walls between them and the countertop. There is a totally enclosed commode room with a single white commode.
<br><br>
There is valet parking.

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Democrats 53</li>
  <li> Republicans 45</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>

At least at first glance, Democratic control of the Senate is in play in the 2014 election. Ten current Democratic seats are contestable. Only two Republican seats are in a contestable category.
<br><br>
Seven Democrats have announced their retirements. Four of those seats are now rated as Toss-Ups: Iowa, South Dakota, Montana, and West Virginia. One additional seat, Michigan, is in the leaning Democrat category. The sixth seat is New Jersey, which is considered safe for the Democrats. The seventh seat is Massachusetts, for which a special election is scheduled. It is likely to remain in Democratic hands.
<br><br>
There are two additional Democratic seats in the Toss Up category, Arkansas and Louisiana. Included in the Leaning Democrat line are Alaska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Michigan.
<br><br>
There are no current Republican seats in the Toss Up category, and only two seats, Georgia and Kentucky, in the Lean Republican category.
<br><br>
Of the six Democratic Toss Up States, Romney won five of them with an average margin of 20 points. Only Iowa was captured by Obama. In the Lean Democratic category, Romney won two of them, Alaska (by 14) and North Carolina (by 2). Obama won New Hampshire (by 6) and Michigan (by 12).
<br><br>
In terms of the allocation of resources, Republicans (and organizations that support Republicans) will be able to spend the largest part of their resources on the attack for the ten Democratic seats. Democrats (and organizations that support Democrats) will have to spend most of their resources defending potentially vulnerable seats.

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

In a recent column, Charlie Cook wrote about the decline in the number of swing Congressional Districts. Among other well-documented points, Cook wrote the following,
<br><br>
“As local print-news readership has declined precipitously in the Internet age, fewer voters are gaining exposure to individual candidates’ backgrounds and qualifications, and party labels have become an even- more-salient cue at the ballot box.”

However, 57% of Americans say they have a great deal/fair amount of confidence that Obama will “recommend the right things” for the economy. [Gallup 4/13]
<br><br>
The NBC/WSJ survey also found Obama’s performance on foreign policy rated positively by 46% to 43%. This is the lowest foreign policy approval rating that Obama has received in this survey going back to April 2009.
<br><br>
On three other current issues Obama’s performance is rated from about even to significant disapproval. On Obama’s handling of immigration the public is split even with 45% disapproval and 44% approval. On the question of his handling of gun policy 52% disapprove of his performance. And, handling the budget, 57% disapprove. [NYT/CBS 4/13]

<ul>
<li> 53% of Americans favor same-sex marriage and 42% oppose it</li>
<li> 64% of those under age 35 support same-sex marriage</li>

<li> 53% of those who have a gay co-worker favor marriage equality</li>
<li> 49% of those who have a gay acquaintance favor same sex marriage</li>
<li> 41% of those who do not know anyone who is gay favor same sex marriage</li>
<li> 79% of those who know a gay/lesbian couple who are in a civil union or
who are married favor marriage equality</li>
<li> 63% say the Federal government should recognize same sex marriages even though only 53% support them</li>
<li> 41% of Republican partisans say the Federal government should recognize same-sex marriages in States that have legalized them</li>
<li> 56% would like to see a Federal standard with a uniform definition of marriage for the whole country, while 38% want it left to the States</li>

However, I had an opportunity to read an early draft of “Stiletto Network” and I found it intriguing. I asked the author, Pamela Ryckman, to send me a paragraph or two describing her book. I was given the opportunity to write a blurb for the book jacket, which follows Ryckman’s description.]
<br><br>
“<strong><em>STILETTO NETWORK</em></strong> is a story of female friendship – disguised as a business story, a tale of women banding together to improve lives and companies and communities, to realize their dreams and change the world. During the past few years, women’s groups have been coalescing in every major American city. Formidable ladies across industries are convening at unprecedented rates; they're creating salons and dinner groups; and collaborating not only to achieve clout and success, but also to create a more just and equal society. Each group has no more than 10 women, but in aggregate they number in the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of women nationwide.
<br><br>
A new girls' network is alive and set to hyper-drive, and <em>STILETTO NETWORK</em> is the first book to shed light on this groundbreaking movement.”
<br><br>
Here is the blurb that I wrote:
<br><br>
“Pamela Ryckman uses good old-fashioned storytelling to illuminate a moment in history where women are poised to make waves in business, politics, and philanthropy. An important read for men who want to know where the world is heading and want to understand the change (without feeling under attack).”
<br><br>

On the first Friday of every month the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the unemployment rate for the previous month.

For the month of April 2013, the unemployment number is 7.5%. Down slightly from March. For March 2013 the unemployment number was 7.6%, down from a high of 10% in October 2009.
<br><br>
There is one small problem with this indicator of “unemployment.” It does not include people who are working part-time, but want full-time employment, nor those who have not looked for work in the last four weeks. When those folks are added, we get an unemployed/underemployed number that is 13.8% for March 2013.

In the first two years of the economic recovery, 2009 to 2011, the misdistribution of wealth between those at the top of the economic ladder and those on the lower rungs grew even larger. From 2009 to 2011, the net worth of those in the top 7% of wealth in this country increased by 28%. For those in the lower 93%, their net worth dropped by 4%. [PEW 4/13]

When asked about the job situation in America, 26% currently say that it is a good time to find a quality job. This compares to 46% who expressed that view in 2007, and 10% in mid 2009. [Gallup 4/13]
<br><br>
32% say that the availability of jobs in their community is getting better, while 15% say it is getting worse. Two years earlier 26% thought availability was improving and 37% said it was getting worse. [WP/ABC 4/13]
<br><br>
45% of us rate our current financial situation as excellent or good. The previous high point was 55% in early 2007. 47% think that their financial situation is getting better, up from a low of 29% in late 2011. [Gallup 4/13]
<br><br>
55% say the amount of income tax they are paying this year is fair. This is somewhat less than the 64% who had that view in 2003.

<h2>Sports, Education, Government Service</h2>
<br><br>
Which is most important in America today – collegiate sports, education or government service?
<br><br>
If the test is the comparative salaries paid to coaches of major collegiate sports teams, the presidents of their respective colleges or universities, or the governors of the States in which these institutions are located, the answer is clear – collegiate sports.
<br><br>
[The source and age of the data below is noted in the chart that follows.]
<br><br>
One of the two most highly compensated football coaches is at the University of Alabama. He makes $5,300,000 per year. The president of Alabama makes $592,000 per year, and the governor makes $121,000. The amount of the coach’s salary is equivalent to a full ride for 221 students ($23,939/year).
<br><br>
The highest paid basketball coach, who receives $7,200,000 per year, is at Duke University. The president of Duke makes $969,000, and the governor of North Carolina makes $140,000. The amount of the coach’s salary is equivalent to a full ride for 125 students ($57,325/year).
<br><br>
The coaches of women’s collegiate basketball teams, 43% of whom are male, generally do not make as much as the coaches of the men’s basketball team. The exception are Tennessee and Rutgers, where the women’s team coaches make more than the men’s team coaches. In general, women’s basketball team coaches also make more than the host university president’s salary, with the exception of Ohio State.
<br><br>
<strong>Top 5 Salaries, College Football and College Basketball</strong>
<br><br>
All coaches’ salaries are for the 2012-2013 Season; Public University President Data is from 2011 fiscal year; Private University President Data is from 2010 fiscal year. Salaries for coaches include base salaries and benefits, but not bonuses; salaries for University Presidents include benefits and bonuses.
