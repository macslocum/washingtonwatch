On the first Friday of every month the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the unemployment rate for the previous month.

For the month of April 2013, the unemployment number is 7.5%. Down slightly from March. For March 2013 the unemployment number was 7.6%, down from a high of 10% in October 2009.
<br><br>
There is one small problem with this indicator of “unemployment.” It does not include people who are working part-time, but want full-time employment, nor those who have not looked for work in the last four weeks. When those folks are added, we get an unemployed/underemployed number that is 13.8% for March 2013.

<h2>Sports, Education, Government Service</h2>
<br><br>
Which is most important in America today – collegiate sports, education or government service?
<br><br>
If the test is the comparative salaries paid to coaches of major collegiate sports teams, the presidents of their respective colleges or universities, or the governors of the States in which these institutions are located, the answer is clear – collegiate sports.
<br><br>
[The source and age of the data below is noted in the chart that follows.]
<br><br>
One of the two most highly compensated football coaches is at the University of Alabama. He makes $5,300,000 per year. The president of Alabama makes $592,000 per year, and the governor makes $121,000. The amount of the coach’s salary is equivalent to a full ride for 221 students ($23,939/year).
<br><br>
The highest paid basketball coach, who receives $7,200,000 per year, is at Duke University. The president of Duke makes $969,000, and the governor of North Carolina makes $140,000. The amount of the coach’s salary is equivalent to a full ride for 125 students ($57,325/year).
<br><br>
The coaches of women’s collegiate basketball teams, 43% of whom are male, generally do not make as much as the coaches of the men’s basketball team. The exception are Tennessee and Rutgers, where the women’s team coaches make more than the men’s team coaches. In general, women’s basketball team coaches also make more than the host university president’s salary, with the exception of Ohio State.
<br><br>
<strong>Top 5 Salaries, College Football and College Basketball</strong>
<br><br>
All coaches’ salaries are for the 2012-2013 Season; Public University President Data is from 2011 fiscal year; Private University President Data is from 2010 fiscal year. Salaries for coaches include base salaries and benefits, but not bonuses; salaries for University Presidents include benefits and bonuses.
