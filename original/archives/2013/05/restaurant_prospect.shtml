<a href="mailto:nfo@prospectsf.com">info@prospectsf.com</a></div>Peggy and Mike took Debbie and me to this restaurant. As a gesture to environmental consciousness, the menu for the evening we were there was printed on the back side of the menu from the night before.
<br><br>
As you enter the modern-appointed restaurant there is a large three-sided bar with some tables around the edges. It turns out there is a Happy Hour from 4-6 p.m. on Friday. We arrived a short time after that period was over, but the whole front of the restaurant was teeming and noisy ,which carried over to the back of the restaurant, until the bar crowd disappeared and the noise level softened.
<br><br>
There is an additional private room suitable for a reception or dinner, down a corridor and roughly across from the restrooms.
<br><br>
For starters - Peggy chose Hawaiian Kampachi Crudo - Golden Enoki, Shitake, Ginger, Sesame, Yuzu, Shiso and Radish.
<br><br>
Debbie selected Nantucket Bay Scallops - Vialone Nano Rissotto, Broccoli Romanesco, Ginger, Extra Virgin Olive Oil (these were the tiny scallops which are often so hard to find).
<br><br>
Mike and Mike enjoyed Hand Picked Dungeness Crab Salad - Brokaw Farm Avocado, Hearts of Palm, Citrus Supremes, Petite Greens.
<br><br>
For her entree Peggy opted for Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette- Panzanella of Asparagus, Various Peas & Bresaola, Spring Alliums, Bloomsdale Spinach, Caramelized Onions, Beef Jus.
<br><br>
Debbie went with Prather Ranch Berkshire Pork - Rose Fingerling Potatoes, Rutabaga & Apple Puree, Rye Whiskey Roasted Pear Hazelnut, Crispy Rye, Lardo & Sage, Port Jus.
<br><br>
The other Mike selected Brandt Farm Prime Ribeye - Pommes Frites, Bloomsdale Spinach, Marrow Bone, Gremolata, Beef Jus.
<br><br>
I had Liberty Valley Duck Breast - Breast & Crispy Rye, Black Quinoa, Rhubarb, Rainbow Chard, Quinoa & Walnut Brittle, Duck Jus.
<br><br>
For dessert. Peggy had a Lemon Meringue Sundae; Debbie savored Strawberry Rhubarb Crepes; the other Mike had Chocolate Cake; and I enjoyed Grapefruit Champagne Basil Sorbet.
<br><br>
Darcey was our server and she was on top of her game.
<br><br>
The men's room is on the dark side as a result of the dark walls and large brown-tiled floor. As you enter, there are two large white ceramic, wall-attached urinals with a floor to head top divider between them. Straight ahead is an enclosed commode area with dark paneling and door that starts about a foot from the floor. (The inside was not observable.) On the right is a long stone wash basin that has a V-shaped inner area. There are three separate sets of faucets.
<br><br>
There is valet parking.
