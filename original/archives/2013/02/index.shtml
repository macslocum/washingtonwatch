<h1>Tosca</h1>
1112 F Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20004<br>
202-367-1990</div>Tosca remains a favorite restaurant, which WW reviewed in June 2002. However, there has been one important change. The men’s room has been remodeled. (WW does not know whether this is also true of women’s room.)
<br><br>
In 2002 WW wrote “The men's room is of ample size, attractive and utilitarian. When you enter there is a single urinal across from two wash basins in a grey marble counter. The walls are tan and adorned with prints of landmark Washington buildings, the Pension Building and the National Archives. There is a full door that opens into a separate room with a single commode and another wash basin, something I have not seen before.”
<br><br>
The new facility is quite different, and better.
<br><br>
On the right as you enter are two circular white ceramic washbasins in a white marble counter with a large mirror behind them. To the left there are now two white ceramic urinals, of differing heights, separated by a partial wall. Straight ahead there is a commode area, separated from the rest of the room by a silver metal, partial wall and door. There is a white ceramic commode with appropriate accessibility bars and ample room to move about.
<br><br>
The wall surrounding the wall mirror, and beneath the wash basin counter is covered in a multi-colored, horizontal design. The floor is covered by very large tan tiles. The walls are painted tan or greenish blue on alternating sides.
<br><br>

<h1>Dino's</h1>
3435 Connecticut Avenue NW<br>
<a href="mailto:eat@dino-dc.com">eat@dino-dc.com</a></div>(Restaurant Yanyu was previously at this location)
<br><br>
Debbie and I went to Dino's with Payton and Randall.
<br><br>
On a Saturday night the restaurant was teeming. Our reservation was for 7:15 p.m. and we were seated as soon as we walked in.
<br><br>
The restaurant seats about 114 people on two floors. The second floor is only reachable by a long relatively steep stairway. The tables range in size from two to 10 people, and are quite close together. And, because of that, it is pretty noisy, but we were able to hold a good conversation without straining.
<br><br>
The menu is quite extensive. There are a total of 83 food items offered, including 5 Cicchetti-Snacks, 17 Antipasti-Starters, 10 Primi-Risotto & Home Made Pasta, 1 Roseda Beef Hamburger, 14 Secondi  Main Dishes, 8 Formaggi di Dino: Cheese, 9 House Charcuterie and Artisan Salumi, 8 Formaggi di Dino: Cheese  11 Desserts. Wines are served in 3oz, 8oz or bottle sizes. Mexican Coke, Mexican Fanta & Mexican Sprite are available, as well as Diet Coke.
<br><br>
Debbie and Payton had exactly the same meal; Santa Monica Farmers Market Fried Baby Artichokes and Local Flounder, griddled, young ginger & lime butter ,winter slaw with Cara Cara organge. At least for Debbie, the artichokes were somewhat disappointing. Both women lauded the flounder.
<br><br>
Randall started with Chard Terrine, chard, Italian ricotta di bufala, egg & breadcrumb, old balsamico & local tomato essence. For his main course he chose Scottiglia  Charcoal Maker's Stew, Roseda Farms briske, Pekin duck leg & Truck Patch pork, rich red wine sauce, 4 cheese polenta.
<br><br>
Mike started with Spice Crusted Calamari, followed by Pappardelle Cinghiale Bianco, ground wild boar, onion, wine, rosemary & cocoa-pecorino. The Pappardelle was quite good, except it could have been a bit warmer when served.
<br><br>
We shared two desserts, both of which we enjoyed: Nutella Bread Pudding and Gianduia Nico bittersweet chocolate gelato with chopped chocolate hazelnut gelato with toasted hazelnuts chocolate sauce vanilla whipped cream.
<br><br>
Dino's notes on its that its fish are sustainable and its meats are raised free of subtheraputic antibiotics, hormones and growth stimulents.
<br><br>
Our server was Dayna, and was as good as any server I have ever encountered and better than most. I was also struck by the speed of service once we had ordered, given that every seat in the restaurant was filled.
<br><br>
The men's room is rather small, and includes a single white ceramic commode and a reddish hard counter on which is located a rectangular silver/grey washbasin. The floor and the walls are covered with blue grey tiles of varying sizes.
<br><br>
The women's room door happened to be open. All that was visible was the reddish counter, on which there was a black circular washbasin.
<br><br>
Parking is a bit of a problem. There is a parking lot across the street in the shopping center, but by 7 p.m. it was closed. We had to drive around a bit before we found a spot on a side street, two long blocks from the restaurant. If you can readily access the subway, the Cleveland Park metro station is across Connecticut Avenue from the restaurant.

<br><br>
81% disapprove of the job that the Congress is doing. It has been in this range since August 2011. The only other time since 1994 that the disapproval rating has approached this level is in June 2008, when 79% expressed their disapproval. [NBC/WSJ 1/13]
<br><br>
In December 54% of Americans rated the honesty and ethical standards of members of Congress as Low/Very Low. 10% rated them as having High/Very High standards. 49% of Americans rated U.S. Senators as having Low/Very low standards, with 14% saying their standards are High/Very High. [Gallup]

<h2>The U.S. Senate</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Democrats 53</li>
  <li> Republicans 45</li>
  <li> Independents 2 (caucus Dem)</li>
</ul>

There are 35 Senate seats up in 2014, and again the Democrats have a substantially larger number of seats to defend (21) than do the Republicans (14).

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

If one includes Independents who caucus with the Democrats, the current Democratic caucus of 55 Senators is the largest that caucus has been since the 103rd Congress 1993-94, with the exception of 2009-10 Congress.

There is little prospect that any of the 14 Republican seats will flip to Democratic in 2014. 13 of these States were won by Romney in 2012 by numbers ranging from 53.4% to 69.3%. Maine was the exception, with Obama winning with 56% of the vote, but the current Republican incumbent Susan Collins is quite popular.
<br><br>
The Democrats have a somewhat rockier path to holding all of their current seats that are up in 2014. Obama won all of the 8 States that are currently rated as Safe Democrat, by numbers ranging from 50.8% to 62.7%. However, when it comes to the 9 States that are rated Leaning Democrat, the recent history is less attractive. Only 4 of those States – Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, and Minnesota – were won by Obama, by margins running from 51.2% to 70.6%. The other 5 – Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, and North Carolina – were won by Romney, with margins ranging from 50.6% to 60.5%.
<br><br>
Of the 4 States now rated as Toss-Ups, 3 have current Democrat incumbents who have chosen to retire, Tom Harkin in Iowa, John Kerry in Massachusetts, and Jay Rockefeller in West Virginia. The current Democratic incumbent in South Dakota, Tim Johnson, is running for re-election ” at this time.” Obama won Iowa and Massachusetts with 52.1% and 60.8% respectively. Romney won South Dakota with 57.9% of the vote and West Virginia with 62.3% of the vote.

At this time, it appears that Massachusetts will stay in Democratic hands, with Ed Markey being the likely Democratic nominee and ultimate victor. West Virginia is more likely than not to end up in Republican hands. According to Nate Silver, the outcome in Iowa may well depend on the name and nature of the Republican candidate, i.e , the more conservative the Republican the better are Democratic prospects to hold the seat. Not much can be said about South Dakota until Tim Johnson decides whether he is running for re-election. To date there are no signs that he is not planning to run. Whether he runs or not, this race is likely to be a real toss up.

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

234 Republicans and 201 Democrats were elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. This represents a switch of 8 seats to the Democrats.
<br><br>
27 incumbent Members of the House were defeated in 2012; 10 Democrats and 17 Republicans.
<br><br>
Democratic Congressional candidates as a group received 59,645,387 of the votes cast (49.16%) for that office, while Republican candidates received 58, 283, 036 (48.03%), a difference of 1,362,351 (1.13%) votes. Other Party candidates received 3,413,981 (2.82%). The final result was 234 Republican seats and 201 Democratic seats. This is only the second time since World War II that the Party getting the most votes did not end up with a majority of the seats in the House.
<br><br>
9.4% of the voters who cast a vote for President in 2012 did not cast a vote in the House race contests.

There were 44 Congressional races in 2012 in which the winning candidate garnered less than 53.0% of the vote. In 35 of these races, the winning margin was less than 6% of the vote.

According to Sabato’s Crystal Ball only 9 of the current 201 Democratic seats appear to have been won by Romney in 2012. Only 16 of the 234 Republican seats appear to have been won by Obama.

                                                            <div class="entry-body">
                                 Federal elections are conducted on geographic playing fields under rules established by each of the States and DC. There are a variety of perfectly legal ways to change the playing fields and the rules. Leading up to the 2012 election, a variety of game-changing efforts were underway, and they continue as we head toward the 2014 election.
<br><br>
At this particular moment in history, most of these efforts for change in playing fields and rules are driven by Republican-controlled State governments and political organizations. However, with the possible exception of voter ID laws, Democrats have also tried to change the playing field and the rules when they had control.

<h2>Gerrymandering</h2>

Leave it to a molecular biologist/neuroscientist to be the latest to study modern gerrymandering of Congressional districts. Sam Wang is an Associate Professor at Princeton University.
<br><br>
Wang makes his case for the impact of modern gerrymandering by examining the Congressional race results in ten States. He has looked at imbalances between the popular vote and the House delegations from that State.
<br><br>
6 States had severe imbalances in favor of Republicans.<br>
1 State had a moderate imbalance in favor of Republicans.<br>
1 State had a severe imbalance in favor of Democrats.<br>
2 States had a moderate imbalance in favor of Democrats.
<br><br>
In all ten States the Republican vote is 7% greater than the Democratic vote. However, the Republicans hold 109 House seats, while Democrats hold 62, a 76% advantage for the Republicans.
<br><br>
Based on a simulation that Wang has prepared, where he removes the impact of gerrymandering, the seat count in the current House of Representatives would be 220 Republicans and 215 Democrats.
<br><br>
At the present time, gerrymandering only affects elections for the House of Representatives. However, if some of the changes being proposed for the Electoral College were to come into being, gerrymandering could become an important issue in Presidential elections.
<br><br>
(For a more extensive discussion of gerrymandering, see “The Great Gerrymander of 2012” by Sam Wang, NYT 2/3/13. If you are not familiar with the Princeton Election Consortium, of which Wang is a founder, it is worth your time to become familiar.)

<h2>Limiting the vote</h2>

In 2012, as is often the case, efforts to pass laws requiring particular proof of identification in order to vote were designed to limit participation of certain classes of voters, namely the poor and non-white.
<br><br>
There is little, if any, evidence that voter impersonation occurs in elections. A recent study of 2000+ reported fraud cases found only “10 cases of alleged in- person voter impersonation.” The larger problems were absentee ballot fraud and voter registration fraud. Requiring voter IDs at the polls does not solve these latter problems. [Washington Post 8/11/12-News21 investigative reporting project]
<br><br>
Law suits were brought against the majority of the most onerous of these laws, and generally the courts halted implementation. However, in any number of cases, judicial action was premised on the passage of these laws too close to the election. Most of these laws are still on the books, and it is fair to assume that efforts will be made to enforce them in 2014.
<br><br>
Other limitations on the “right to vote” include cutting back the hours for early voting and not having sufficient voting facilities in certain neighborhoods.

<h2>The Electoral College</h2>

63% of Americans would vote to do away with the Electoral College. On this question there is not much difference between the Parties. 61% of Republicans, 66% of Democrats, and 63% of Independents hold this view. [Gallup]
<br><br>
Up until 1972 all States granted all of their electoral votes to the candidate who won Statewide. In that year, Maine changed to its current system of apportioning electoral votes. In 1992 Nebraska adopted the Maine system.
<br><br>
There has been considerable noise about the possibility of additional States adopting the Maine/Nebraska method. In those States the winner of each Congressional District gets one electoral vote and the Statewide winner gets 2 votes.
<br><br>
7 swing States, currently controlled by Republicans, have been identified as States in which efforts may be made to adopt the Maine/Nebraska apportionment method: Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
<br><br>
In these seven States Obama won the electoral contest by 107 to 15 electoral votes. If the Maine/Nebraska system had been in place in these seven States, Obama would have won only 48 electoral votes and Romney would have won 74. Obama would still have won the election, but only by 273 to 265 electoral votes.
<br><br>
In the twelve swing States, Obama received 137 electoral votes to Romney’s 15 electoral votes. If the Maine/Nebraska system had been in place, Romney would have captured 80 electoral votes and Obama 72 electoral votes. Romney would have won the Electoral College victory by 271 to 267.
<br><br>
According to David Wasserman of the “Cook Political Report,” if the whole nation adopted the Maine/Nebraska system, Romney would have won the election by 276 to 262 electoral votes.
<br><br>
Other than the Maine/Nebraska system, a couple of other possible changes have been floated. One plan would follow Maine/Nebraska, except that the two non-CD votes would be given to the candidate who won the most Congressional Districts in the States. In still another modification, the electoral votes of each State would be granted on a proportional basis.
<br><br>
As these ideas have gained some momentum, Republican elected officials in Virginia and Wisconsin have voiced their opposition to the proposals.
<br><br>
Over the years hundreds of proposals to change the Electoral College have been floated. Obviously, other than in Maine and Nebraska, the system in place has been in place since the first Presidential election.
<br><br>
After the 1968 election, in which Nixon received 301 electoral votes to Humphrey’s 191 electoral votes, even though nationwide Nixon accumulated only a half million more votes than Humphrey (Wallace received 46 electoral votes), there was a Democratic-led effort to eliminate the Electoral College.
<br><br>
Democratic Representative Emanuel Celler and Democratic Senator Birch Bayh introduced a Constitutional Amendment to abolish the Electoral College and have the President selected on the basis of the nationwide popular vote. If the winning candidate did not receive at least 40% of the vote, there would be a runoff of the top two candidates.
<br><br>
The proposed amendment was adopted by the House Judiciary Committee and the full House of Representatives in the fall of 1969. The amendment was then adopted by the Senate Judiciary Committee. When it got to the Senate floor, proponents were unable to muster the necessary two-thirds majority and the amendment died.

49.1% is the average job approval rating that Obama realized during his first four years in office. President Clinton was only .5% higher at 49.6%. Obama ranks 10th and Clinton 9th in the average approval rating of the last twelve Presidents. Only Presidents Ford (partial term) and Carter had lower average approval ratings for their first terms.

In his fourth year in office, the high level of political polarization of President Obama’s job approval rating is matched only by President G.W. Bush’s in his fourth year in office. In each case, the gap between approval from their Party faithful and the other Party is 76 points. Bush did slightly better with Democrats than Obama does with Republicans.
<br><br>
President Clinton in his fourth year had a 61-point spread between his Democratic and Republican approval.

<br><br>
In 2012, the Obama campaign raised $732,741,988 [ $778,642,862 in 2008]. The Romney campaign raised $478,704,347 in 2012 [McCain raised $379,006,485 in 2008].
<br><br>
While the Obama campaign committee outraised the Romney campaign committee by $254 million, the Republican National Committee outraised the Democratic National Committee by $85 million. The Romney-supporting Super PAC, Restore our Future, outraised the Obama-supporting Super PAC, Priorities USA Action, by $74 million.

Communication or coordination between the Super PACs and the candidates they support was not permitted. However, given the fact that each of the Super PACs was run by folks loyal to the respective candidates, it is not beyond the pale to combine their revenues with the spending of the candidate and Party committees for the purpose of estimating the financial resources available to each candidate.

Here are five conservative and five liberal Super PACs that were particularly active in addition to those cited above. Most of their spending was directed at Congressional campaigns.

None of the above relates to the substantial spending done by a variety of so- called 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.

Many commentators, including WW, look to the data driven technology and organization that the Obama campaign used to turn out the vote as the primary basis for Obama’s election victory.
<br><br>
Mathew Dowd, for whom WW has a high regard, brings a different perspective to the question of why Obama won.
<br><br>
He agrees that the organization, the advertising dollars, and Presidential visits to the battleground States had an effect. However he suggests that there are three other factors that drove the Obama victory.
<br><br>
Those factors are a flawed opponent, a recovering economy which lifted Obama’s job approval number, and Hurricane Sandy, which allowed Obama to demonstrate that he is a strong, effective leader.

<h2>The Advertising</h2>

Elizabeth Wilner, at Kantor Media, and the Cook Political Report have reported data about advertising that I do not recall having seen after any previous election.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> More than 800 advertisers bought TV advertising in U.S Senate and House races in 2012</li>
<li> 195 different advertisers bought TV time in U.S. Senate races</li>
<li> 615 different advertisers bought TV time in U.S. House races</li>
</ul>
