<h1>Tosca</h1>
1112 F Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20004<br>
202-367-1990</div>Tosca remains a favorite restaurant, which WW reviewed in June 2002. However, there has been one important change. The men’s room has been remodeled. (WW does not know whether this is also true of women’s room.)
<br><br>
In 2002 WW wrote “The men's room is of ample size, attractive and utilitarian. When you enter there is a single urinal across from two wash basins in a grey marble counter. The walls are tan and adorned with prints of landmark Washington buildings, the Pension Building and the National Archives. There is a full door that opens into a separate room with a single commode and another wash basin, something I have not seen before.”
<br><br>
The new facility is quite different, and better.
<br><br>
On the right as you enter are two circular white ceramic washbasins in a white marble counter with a large mirror behind them. To the left there are now two white ceramic urinals, of differing heights, separated by a partial wall. Straight ahead there is a commode area, separated from the rest of the room by a silver metal, partial wall and door. There is a white ceramic commode with appropriate accessibility bars and ample room to move about.
<br><br>
The wall surrounding the wall mirror, and beneath the wash basin counter is covered in a multi-colored, horizontal design. The floor is covered by very large tan tiles. The walls are painted tan or greenish blue on alternating sides.
