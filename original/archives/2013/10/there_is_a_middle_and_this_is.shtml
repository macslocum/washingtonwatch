<p></p>
NBC News and Esquire Magazine have conducted a fascinating study entitled the “New American Center.” The summary of the research is that there is a “large group of American voters -- even a majority -- who make up a ‘New American Center’.”
<br><br>
Through a variety of screens the survey develops a picture of America’s political spectrum today as 21% on the left, 28% on the right, and 51% as the “New American Center.”
<br><br>
Here are selected findings from the survey of the attitudes of the people in the New Center.
<br><br>
When it comes to political issues:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 28% identify as Republican </li>
<li> 36% identify as Democrats </li>
<li> 36% identify as Independents</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> 75% (58% strongly,17% somewhat) support requiring all registered voters to show a photo ID, such as a valid driver’s license, at the polling booth</li>
<li> 54% (38% strongly,16% somewhat) support providing illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship, even though they have broken the rules</li>
<li> 54% agree that the Constitution can’t provide guidance for many of the modern problems we face now</li>
<li> 49% agree that the two-party system we have in this country is broken and out of date, and America would be better off if there were more than just major two parties</li>
<li> 58% are pessimistic about the politics in this country</li>
<li> 72% say that in deciding who to vote for, the fact that they agree with the candidate on important issues is most important</li>
<li> 65% say they are willing to vote for someone they personally dislike if they strongly agree with his or her positions on the issues</li>
<li> 71% say that, more often than not, they feel as though they are voting for the lesser of two evils</li>
<li> 34% own a gun or live in a household where someone owns a gun</li>
<li> 45% think that background checks do not violate the Second Amendment</li>
<li> 59% agree that churches and religious organizations should have no role in politics</li>
<li> 67% (44% strongly,23% somewhat) agree that government should guarantee that people get equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender or race</li>
<li> 44% believe that marriage is between two people who love each other and are committed to each other, regardless of whether they are men or women. An additional 11% believe that preventing the marriage of gay people is discrimination. Further, 23% would support civil unions that give gay couples the same rights as married couples.</li>
<li>When it comes to government spending</li>
<ul>
<li> 40% believe it is wasteful and inefficient</li>
<li> 39% believe gov’t spending should never exceed what it takes in</li>
<li> 77% (50% strongly/27% somewhat) support a Constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget each year</li>
</ul>
<li> 78% (59% strongly,19% somewhat) support raising taxes on those who make more than $1 million a year</li>
<li> 80% (54% strongly/26% somewhat) believe the government should expand exploration for U.S.-based oil and gas reserves.</li>
<li> 64% (46% strongly,18% somewhat) oppose ending the death penalty</li>
<li> 58% agree that, when it comes to politics, they often agree with some ideas that Democrats have and some ideas that Republicans have</li>
<li> 44% agree that, when it comes to politics, both Democrats and Republicans get it wrong most of the time, and they rarely agree with the ideas of either Party</li>
</ul>
[Research was conducted in August by The Berenson Strategy Group (Obama’s pollster) and Public Opinion Strategies (Romney’s pollster)].
