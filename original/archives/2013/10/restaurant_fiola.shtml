Debbie and I went to Fiola soon after it opened, but for reasons I cannot now recall, I decided not to write about it.
<br><br>
We have now been to the restaurant several times, most recently with Judy and Ray.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant the greeting stand is to your left and the multi- seat oblong bar is straight ahead. To the left there is an area for cocktails and a reasonable amount of room to stand and imbibe.
<br><br>
The dining area is a couple of steps down, but fully visible from the entry way. The main dining room is split in two sections that run the length of the main dining area. There are a number of oval banquettes with tables for four people along the far walls. At the far end of the room is an area that can be used as part of the main dining room or as one or two private eating areas.
<br><br>
It was a bit noisy, and while you could easily talk to the person next to you, it was hard for the person at the end of the table to participate in the same conversation.
<br><br>
All in all, I like the atmosphere.
<br><br>
Judy and I started with Maine Peekytoe Crab, Maria’s Chilled Gazpacho, Sea Urchin, Paddlefish Caviar. Debbie and Ray had the Earth’n East Farm Greens, Radish, Honeycrisp Apples, Birbetta Cheese, Pine nuts.
<br><br>
Judy and Ray selected as their main course the Duo of Veal Ribeye, Veal Cheek, Ossobuco Sauce, Alba Hazelnuts, Wild Mushrooms, Cremolada. Debbie opted for the Fiola Maine Lobster Ravioli, Ginger, Chives. I picked Wild Cod, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Kabocha Squash, Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Black Truffle.
<br><br>
The restaurant offers a five or six course tasting menu. Everything on those menus can be ordered a la Carte. While we did not try any of these dishes, here is the six course menu for the night we were at the restaurant:
<br><br>
Adriatic Frutti di Mare, Paddlefish Caviar; Poached Kampachi, Baby Artichokes, Salsa Verde; Ravioli of Sheep’s Ricotta, Fresh Herbs, Black Truffle; Wild Scottish Wood Pigeon, Fair Gras, Wild Huckleberry; Artisanal Cheeses from Fossa Dell’ Abbondanza; Vanilla Panna Cotta, Turkish figs. The price was $130. The wine pairing almost doubles the cost.
<br><br>
There is valet parking.
