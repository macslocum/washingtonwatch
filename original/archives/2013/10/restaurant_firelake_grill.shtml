<a href="mailto:firelakeg@yahoo.com">Firelakeg@yahoo.com</a></div>The Firelake Grill is a relatively new addition to the Tenley Park area.  It has been open since August.
<br><br>
Debbie and I first went to Firelake with Bob and Rita, who had been there a couple of times before.
<br><br>
The restaurant is very large, seating over two hundred people in a combination of booths, tables, and a square, three-sided bar with high stools for about 20 people.
<br><br>
The hosts and the serving people are all young and as nice as can be. Although they are not as quite as alert to signals for attention from their customers as might be desired, but that will come over time.
<br><br>
The music coming through the sound system was pretty loud in the area at which you enter the restaurant. We asked for a table that was as far away from the sound as possible, and ended up in a booth at the far end of the restaurant, on the Wisconsin Avenue side.
<br><br>
The menu demonstrates that it is an American-style restaurant. There are 13 Starters & Sides ranging from Spinach & Artichoke Dip to Texas Toast.
<br><br>
If Burgers and Sandwiches are your choice, there are 6 ranging from Hickory Burgers to Fish Sandwiches.
<br><br>
Looking for a salad? There are 7 that run the gamut from Thai Steak & Noodle Salad to a Classic Wedge Salad.
<br><br>
There is a different soup each day and 12 Entrees running from Barbecue Ribs to Tuna Steak.
<br><br>
And finally, there are 4 Desserts. There is also a childrens menu.
<br><br>
Rita had the fish of the day, which was Halibut, accompanied by mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. True to form, Bob ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Cole Slaw.
<br><br>
Debbie ordered the Roasted Prime Rib (you can choose a 12 or 16 oz. portion), medium rare with Onion Rings. About half of the meat was too rare to eat at the time, but was excellent taken home and eaten for lunch the next day.
<br><br>
I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Mashed Potatoes and Coleslaw. The crab cakes were particularly good.
<br><br>
Bob and Rita shared Key Lime Pie for dessert, and Debbie and I shared Apple Walnut Cobbler.
<br><br>
As you enter the mens room, to the left is a wall hanging urinal. To the right of the urinal are two commode stalls with doors that are open at the top and bottom. To the right, as you enter, are three oval, white ceramic washbasins with individual stands, as well as a mirror that hangs over them.
<br><br>
The floor is covered with large black and white tiles. The walls are white tile, with the exception of a strip of black at floor level and at about the six foot level. There are also some diamond-shaped black tile designs just below the six foot level tiles on the far wall.
<br><br>
There is free parking in the building garage 7 days a week, and free valet parking on Wisconsin Avenue, Wednesday night through Sunday Brunch.
