78% say that the country is off on the wrong track. This is a jump of 16% since early September.
<br><br>
Only 14% say the country is going in the right direction, down 16% from September. The wrong track number was in the 70s during most of 2008, and hit 78% in October 2008. Going back further, to September 2001, the wrong track number never reached 78%. The last time the right track number hit 14% or lower was in October 2008, when it dropped to 12%. [NBC/WSJ 10/7/13]

In 2005, 78% of us trusted the “American people” to make judgments about political issues facing the country, and 58% trusted “politicians” to make those judgments. Today, only 61% trust the “American people” and only 46% trust the “politicians.”
<br><br>
In mid-2012, 38% of Americans thought it was best to have a one-party Federal government, with the President and Congress being of the same party. Over the last decade it has been as high as 40% (in mid-2010). Today, it is 25%.
<br><br>
In that same time period, the expressed need for a third major U.S. political party has reached a new high, with 60% holding that view. The previous high was 58% in mid-2010 and mid-2007. [Gallup 9/27/13, 10/11/13]

<br><br>

The median, inflation-adjusted income of households in the U.S. has not yet returned to its 1999 high.
<br><br>
$51,017 -- 2012 <br>
$55,627 – 2007 <br>
$56,080 – 1999 <br>
$48,884 -- 1993<br>

Women earned 76.5 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2012. This is slightly less than the 77 cents they earned in 2011. The current median income for men is $49,398. The median income for women is $37,791.
<br><br>
From 1980 to 1990, women moved up 11.4 cents for every dollar earned by a man, an increase from 60.2 cents to 71.6 cents. However, in the 22 years from 1990 to 2012 the upward movement has only been 4.9 cents.
