<h1>Firelake Grill</h1>
4200 Wisconsin Ave NW<br>
(Corner of Wisconsin and Van Ness)<br>
Washington, DC 20016<br>

Fax 202-263-1550<br>
<a href="mailto:firelakeg@yahoo.com">Firelakeg@yahoo.com</a></div>The Firelake Grill is a relatively new addition to the Tenley Park area.  It has been open since August.
<br><br>
Debbie and I first went to Firelake with Bob and Rita, who had been there a couple of times before.
<br><br>
The restaurant is very large, seating over two hundred people in a combination of booths, tables, and a square, three-sided bar with high stools for about 20 people.
<br><br>
The hosts and the serving people are all young and as nice as can be. Although they are not as quite as alert to signals for attention from their customers as might be desired, but that will come over time.
<br><br>
The music coming through the sound system was pretty loud in the area at which you enter the restaurant. We asked for a table that was as far away from the sound as possible, and ended up in a booth at the far end of the restaurant, on the Wisconsin Avenue side.
<br><br>
The menu demonstrates that it is an American-style restaurant. There are 13 Starters & Sides ranging from Spinach & Artichoke Dip to Texas Toast.
<br><br>
If Burgers and Sandwiches are your choice, there are 6 ranging from Hickory Burgers to Fish Sandwiches.
<br><br>
Looking for a salad? There are 7 that run the gamut from Thai Steak & Noodle Salad to a Classic Wedge Salad.
<br><br>
There is a different soup each day and 12 Entrees running from Barbecue Ribs to Tuna Steak.
<br><br>
And finally, there are 4 Desserts. There is also a childrens menu.
<br><br>
Rita had the fish of the day, which was Halibut, accompanied by mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. True to form, Bob ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Cole Slaw.
<br><br>
Debbie ordered the Roasted Prime Rib (you can choose a 12 or 16 oz. portion), medium rare with Onion Rings. About half of the meat was too rare to eat at the time, but was excellent taken home and eaten for lunch the next day.
<br><br>
I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with Mashed Potatoes and Coleslaw. The crab cakes were particularly good.
<br><br>
Bob and Rita shared Key Lime Pie for dessert, and Debbie and I shared Apple Walnut Cobbler.
<br><br>
As you enter the mens room, to the left is a wall hanging urinal. To the right of the urinal are two commode stalls with doors that are open at the top and bottom. To the right, as you enter, are three oval, white ceramic washbasins with individual stands, as well as a mirror that hangs over them.
<br><br>
The floor is covered with large black and white tiles. The walls are white tile, with the exception of a strip of black at floor level and at about the six foot level. There are also some diamond-shaped black tile designs just below the six foot level tiles on the far wall.
<br><br>
There is free parking in the building garage 7 days a week, and free valet parking on Wisconsin Avenue, Wednesday night through Sunday Brunch.

Debbie and I went to Fiola soon after it opened, but for reasons I cannot now recall, I decided not to write about it.
<br><br>
We have now been to the restaurant several times, most recently with Judy and Ray.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant the greeting stand is to your left and the multi- seat oblong bar is straight ahead. To the left there is an area for cocktails and a reasonable amount of room to stand and imbibe.
<br><br>
The dining area is a couple of steps down, but fully visible from the entry way. The main dining room is split in two sections that run the length of the main dining area. There are a number of oval banquettes with tables for four people along the far walls. At the far end of the room is an area that can be used as part of the main dining room or as one or two private eating areas.
<br><br>
It was a bit noisy, and while you could easily talk to the person next to you, it was hard for the person at the end of the table to participate in the same conversation.
<br><br>
All in all, I like the atmosphere.
<br><br>
Judy and I started with Maine Peekytoe Crab, Maria’s Chilled Gazpacho, Sea Urchin, Paddlefish Caviar. Debbie and Ray had the Earth’n East Farm Greens, Radish, Honeycrisp Apples, Birbetta Cheese, Pine nuts.
<br><br>
Judy and Ray selected as their main course the Duo of Veal Ribeye, Veal Cheek, Ossobuco Sauce, Alba Hazelnuts, Wild Mushrooms, Cremolada. Debbie opted for the Fiola Maine Lobster Ravioli, Ginger, Chives. I picked Wild Cod, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Kabocha Squash, Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Black Truffle.
<br><br>
The restaurant offers a five or six course tasting menu. Everything on those menus can be ordered a la Carte. While we did not try any of these dishes, here is the six course menu for the night we were at the restaurant:
<br><br>
Adriatic Frutti di Mare, Paddlefish Caviar; Poached Kampachi, Baby Artichokes, Salsa Verde; Ravioli of Sheep’s Ricotta, Fresh Herbs, Black Truffle; Wild Scottish Wood Pigeon, Fair Gras, Wild Huckleberry; Artisanal Cheeses from Fossa Dell’ Abbondanza; Vanilla Panna Cotta, Turkish figs. The price was $130. The wine pairing almost doubles the cost.
<br><br>
There is valet parking.

                                 In the most recent Gallup survey, 11% approve of the job being done by Congress, while 85% disapprove. This is a drop of 8 percentage points in the last month. Notably, while Congressional job approval has dropped from 17% to 15% among Republicans, it has dropped from 20% to 5% (15 points) among Democrats. The average overall approval rating for this year is 15%, the lowest annual average since the question was first asked in 1974. [Gallup 10/13]
<br><br>
At least for the moment, the Republican Party is rated favorably by 28%. This is the lowest number reported for either Party since Gallup began asking the relevant question in 1992. The previous low of 31% was also achieved by the Republicans in 1999.
<br><br>
The Democratic Party is rated favorably by 43% of the public. The previous low was 42% in 2010. [Gallup 10/9/13]

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

On the question of whether respondents would prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats or Republicans in 2014, 47% said they would prefer a Democrat- controlled Congress, and 39% would prefer Republican control. In a September 2013 survey the spread was only 3 points, 46% to 43%, preferring Democratic control.
<br><br>
Looking back at the last seven general elections (1998-2012) , there seems to be little relationship between the Congressional control preferences in September/October of the year before the election and the outcome of the subsequent election.
<br><br>
If given the opportunity on the next general election ballot to replace the entire Congress, 60% would take that option. This is the highest number recorded since NBC/WSJ began asking this question in March 2010. [NBC/WSJ 10/13]

<h2>The House of Representatives</h2>

There has been some change in the structure of the House of Representatives races since the <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/2013/09/the_congress_21.shtml">September issue of the Watch</a>, based on the Cook Political Report. These changes were driven by the role of the Republican members of Congress in the recent government shutdown.
<br><br>
As it has for a very long time, WW regularly reprints and relies on the analysis of House races published by the “Cook Political Report.”

<h1>RL Restaurant (Ralph Lauren)</h1>
115 East Chicago Avenue<br>
Chicago, Illinois 60611<br>

The restaurant, opened by Ralph Lauren, is adjacent to the Polo store in Chicago.
<br><br>
The restaurant was the first opened by Lauren, in 1999, and was not very successful for a number of reasons, one being that the food was not very good. Management has since been taken over by the team that runs Gibson's Steak House in Chicago (and a number of other restaurants). It became a hit and remains a must -stop on any tour of Chicago culinary hot spots. [Note: Three years ago, Lauren opened an all-American restaurant on the Left Bank in Paris. It is very successful. He plans to open a third restaurant in New York City. (NYT 10/13/13, Style Section)]
<br><br>
Debbie and I went to RL with Bill and Bernie.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, on a weather-permitting evening, you walk through a number of sidewalk tables to get to the main door. Straight ahead is the reception stand. Directly to the left are a relatively small bar and a few tables. The dining room is straight ahead.
<br><br>
The decor is as you would expect in a restaurant designed and opened by Lauren. It is relatively dark, with heavy dark wooden walls and lots of art. There are banquettes around the entire restaurant. The dining room seats up to 81 people at 2s, 4s and 6s. The tables are quite close to each other, and one moves through the room with care, although the serving folks move through the maze with ease.
<br><br>
Bernie started by asking for Smoked Salmon which she had ordered before but was not on the current menu. It came. Bill selected a half dozen oysters. Debbie picked a Heirloom Tomato salad and I chose a Caesar Salad. (I was sore tempted to order something that I have not seen on a menu -- Baked Cheese, Saint Andre Triple Cream, Phyllo Dough, Poached Pear, and Maple syrup, but I resisted.)
<br><br>
For her main course Bernie requested Halibut, which was an off-the-menu special for the evening. Bill and Debbie each chose Bone-in Ribeyes, which neither of them was able to finish. (Bernie suggested that Bill should have requested the steak without the added butter. He did not follow the suggestion.) I opted for Lake Perch, which I do not recall having found on a restaurant menu since I left Duluth.
<br><br>
For dessert Bill ordered Cheesecake, which he and Debbie basically shared. I ordered Sorbet, of which Bernie had a bite.
<br><br>
Getting to the restrooms is a bit of a trek. First, you work your way to the back of the dining room, and then take an elevator down one floor. The decor in the elevator area is like the rest of the restaurant. As you enter the men's room there is a short hallway with a very large mirror at the end. You then enter the men's room.
<br><br>
Immediately to your right is a light marble counter top, with two sunken washbasins with golden faucets and a huge mirror dead ahead. There are two separate, fully-enclosed commode rooms. There are no urinals. The floor is covered with small white tiles. The walls are painted off-white.
<br><br>
The restaurant's website says that walk-ins are welcome, but don't count on being able to get a table all that quickly. Better to take no chances and make a reservation.
<br><br>
The bar is open to midnight seven nights a week, and there is valet parking after 8 p.m.

From a high of 51%, the approval of the President’s job performance by business owners is currently at 37%. That is up from the low of 31% recorded in of mid-2011. Among “all workers” Obama’s approval has dropped from 63% in 2009 to 45% today. It has been as low as 41% (also in 2011). [Gallup 10/2/13]
<br><br>
Obama’s performance on the economy continues to be rated negatively. Fox News reported disapproval 56% to 40% on 10/2/13. On 9/23/13, CBS/NYT poll showed disapproval at 54% to 41%.
<br><br>
The rating of the President’s performance on foreign policy is almost as bleak. The CBS/NYT survey 9/23/13 reported disapproval at 49% to 40%.

While the public disapproves of the way Obama has handled the negotiations over the budget by 51% to 45%, and while the Democrats in Congress are rated less negatively than Republicans in the Congress, neither of these groups has much to crow about. The Democrats are rated negatively by 61% to 35%; the Republicans are rated negatively by 70% to 24%. [WP/ABC 10/6/13]
<br><br>
Since January Barack Obama’s positive rating has dropped from 52% to 47% (-5). The other two principle players in the budget drama have remained steady, although much in negative territory. House Speaker John Boehner had a positive rating of 18% in January and today it is 17%. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had a positive rating of 16% and has bumped up to18% today.

We do not yet have a measure of the President’s job approval rating since the end of the government shutdown and the extension of the debit limit. Thus, the public score for his actions during the last few weeks has yet to come.
<br><br>
Whatever that score turns out to be, the President’s active involvement and the firmness of his position, both publicly and privately during the shutdown/debt ceiling action, portends well for a better than expected second term.

It is way too early to handicap the 2016 Presidential race. So, for the foreseeable future the Watch’s only attention to the race will be to keep a running list of folks who are getting serious mention. The Republican list has been expanded since the September edition of WW.

Seven states, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and Idaho, have either passed or considered legislation demanding that the Federal government turn over to the States control of millions of acres of Federal public land within their borders. For example, 81% of the land in Nevada and 66.5% of the land in Utah are under control of the Federal government.
<br><br>
The short term prospects for such exchanges is low, but the recent shut down of national parks, etc. gave the States a new opportunity to make their argument. [WP 10/18/13]

                                 NBC News and Esquire Magazine have conducted a fascinating study entitled the “New American Center.” The summary of the research is that there is a “large group of American voters -- even a majority -- who make up a ‘New American Center’.”

<li> 54% agree that the Constitution can’t provide guidance for many of the modern problems we face now</li>

An additional 11% believe that preventing the marriage of gay people is discrimination. Further, 23% would support civil unions that give gay couples the same rights as married couples.</li>

</ul>

Only 14% say the country is going in the right direction, down 16% from September. The wrong track number was in the 70s during most of 2008, and hit 78% in October 2008. Going back further, to September 2001, the wrong track number never reached 78%. The last time the right track number hit 14% or lower was in October 2008, when it dropped to 12%. [NBC/WSJ 10/7/13]

<br><br>
The Gallup 30-day rolling average survey has continued. As of September 30th it found unemployment to be 7.7% and underemployment to be 17.1%.

In 2005, 78% of us trusted the “American people” to make judgments about political issues facing the country, and 58% trusted “politicians” to make those judgments. Today, only 61% trust the “American people” and only 46% trust the “politicians.”
<br><br>
In mid-2012, 38% of Americans thought it was best to have a one-party Federal government, with the President and Congress being of the same party. Over the last decade it has been as high as 40% (in mid-2010). Today, it is 25%.
<br><br>
In that same time period, the expressed need for a third major U.S. political party has reached a new high, with 60% holding that view. The previous high was 58% in mid-2010 and mid-2007. [Gallup 9/27/13, 10/11/13]

The median, inflation-adjusted income of households in the U.S. has not yet returned to its 1999 high.
<br><br>
$51,017 -- 2012 <br>
$55,627 – 2007 <br>
$56,080 – 1999 <br>
$48,884 -- 1993<br>
<br>
Women earned 76.5 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2012. This is slightly less than the 77 cents they earned in 2011. The current median income for men is $49,398. The median income for women is $37,791.
<br><br>
From 1980 to 1990, women moved up 11.4 cents for every dollar earned by a man, an increase from 60.2 cents to 71.6 cents. However, in the 22 years from 1990 to 2012 the upward movement has only been 4.9 cents.
<br><br>
19.7% of Americans are living in or near the poverty level (125 % of poverty level), while 15% are living below the poverty level.
<br><br>
