In 1973, 60% of Americans had confidence in the Federal government’s handling domestic problems. By 2002 that number was 77%. Today it is 42%, the lowest number ever recorded by Gallup. [Gallup 9/13/13]
<br><br>
Trust in the legislative branch of the Federal government has reached a new low. 34% now say they have confidence in that body. 51% retain confidence in the executive branch and 64% have confidence in the judiciary. [Gallup 9/26/13]

Seven states, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and Idaho, have either passed or considered legislation demanding that the Federal government turn over to the States control of millions of acres of Federal public land within their borders. For example, 81% of the land in Nevada and 66.5% of the land in Utah are under control of the Federal government.
<br><br>
The short term prospects for such exchanges is low, but the recent shut down of national parks, etc. gave the States a new opportunity to make their argument. [WP 10/18/13]
