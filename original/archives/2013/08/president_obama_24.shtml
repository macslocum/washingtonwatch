Charlie Cook (Cook Political Report) summarizes President Obama’s situation: “...voters increasingly seem to have hit the mute button on President Obama. They are no longer listening to him and his approval numbers seem to be dropping by about a point every two weeks. This does not seem to be because of any of the so-called scandals that got Republicans so worked up during the winter and spring, but more because voters have a perception of Obama as a not particularly effective leader.”
