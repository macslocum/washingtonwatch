NBC/WSJ [7/21/13] found 61% of Americans believe that things are on the wrong track in this country. ABC/WP [7/21/13] also found 61% with that view. PEW [7/21/13] found 67% dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country.

For the month of June 2013 “unemployment” stands at 7.4%, down 0.2 % from May 2013, and 0.1% from April, when the rate was 7.5%. However, this number does not include people who are working part-time, but want full-time employment. Nor does it include those who have not looked for work in the last four weeks. When those folks are added, we get an unemployed/underemployed number that is 13.8% for July 2013. [U.S. BLS]

Whether Democrats or Republicans are “satisfied with the work the federal government is doing” in various areas depends on which Party controls the White House.
<br><br>
In 2013, with Barack Obama in the White House, 73% of Democrats are satisfied with the work being done by the government on the nation’s military and national defense, but only 35% of Republicans hold that view.
<br><br>
In 2005, with George W. Bush in the White House, 88% of Republicans, but only 34% of Democrats, were satisfied with the work being done on the military and national defense.
<br><br>
Seventeen of the same government actions were included in the questions asked in both 2013 and 2005. On not a single issue in 2013 (Obama is President) were the Republicans more satisfied than the Democrats. And, on no issue in 2005 (Bush is President) were the Democrats more satisfied than the Republicans. [Gallup 7/13]

In recent months considerable attention has been paid to the question of sexual assaults in the military. Pentagon reports suggest that 3,374 instances of sexual assault were reported in the fiscal year that ended last September 30th. And the Pentagon estimates that as many as 26,000 sexual assaults may have occurred in that year.
<br><br>
Legislation has been introduced in the Senate and House to change the way in which the military handles these cases.
<br><br>
<a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-10/opinions/39167125_1_lawyers-behavior-sexual-harassment-and-assault">One recent article</a> on this subject caught WW’s eye. The author is Monica Medina, who served in the army for four years and was a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense. The article suggests a four step solution which seems to make sense.
<br><br>
"<strong>First</strong>, crack down on hard drinking and drugs. The military’s attitude toward these 'bad boy' behaviors is the true 'don’t ask, don’t tell' issue among the ranks.
<br><br>
<strong>Second</strong>, show offenders to the door.
<br><br>
<strong>Third</strong>, provide victims of sexual assault with their own lawyers.
<br><br>
<strong>Fourth</strong>, hire and promote more women. Half the U.S. population is female, but the share of women in our armed forces has peaked at around 15 percent."
<br><br>
The <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-10/opinions/39167125_1_lawyers-behavior-sexual-harassment-and-assault">full article</a> can be found in the Washington Post and The Cap Times.
