<a href="http://www.matchboxchinatown.com">www.matchboxchinatown.com</a></div>This is another of the seemingly endless number of restaurants in Chinatown. I was there for a lunch meeting with two others on a weekday.
<br><br>
The restaurant is relatively narrow and operates on two levels. As you enter, just past the reception desk, there is a bar with high stools and a huge, live fire. To the right, up a half level, is a long dining area, including booths and tables.
<br><br>
While the restaurant had been described to me by the person recommending it as having great pizza, the menu is well beyond pizza, and includes appetizers, sandwiches, salads, entrees....and pizza.
<br><br>
One of our party had “honey-miso salmon” with honey-mustard miso, tempura Shiitake, rice noodles, spinach, and carrots. The second person, who had been there before, ordered a small pizza, the toppings for which I failed to note.
<br><br>
I started with a “matchbox chopped salad” with diced tomato, crispy bacon, red onions, pasta ringlets, creamy herb vinaigrette. I followed that with a small “veggie pizza” with roasted garlic, pesto, oven-dried tomato, artichokes. Ordinarily, that particular pizza comes with pecorino Romano and mozzarella. Shortly after taking our order the serving person returned to say that, because I had asked that the cheese be left off the pizza, they wanted me to know that there was a small amount of cheese in the pesto.
<br><br>
One of the nice features of the matchbox menu is that there are several appetizers and salads, and all of the pizzas can be ordered in a smaller or larger size.
<br><br>
All of the folks with whom you interact, from the reception desk through the serving staff, are receptive, attentive and helpful.
<br><br>
Reservations are a good idea.
