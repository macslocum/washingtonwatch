The restaurant has several rows of booths, and then a variety of two, four, six, eight and ten-person tables. The ten of us were again seated at a round table.
<br><br>
There is a bar along one side, that is raised from the dining room floor. It seats 12-15 folks on high stools at the bar, and has a row of tall tables with stools located at the dining room edge of the bar area.
<br><br>
There is an open kitchen that is open to a corridor which carries a fair amount of traffic between serving people picking up orders and folks heading for the rest rooms.
<br><br>
The chef came by to greet us. Ron asked him which of the fish selections had come in that day and which had come in the day before....he told us.
<br><br>
A large plate of Crispy Fish Tostadas were delivered to the table as an unordered starter.
<br><br>
Again a number of people in our party opted to order two appetizers or other starters.
<br><br>
Lynn - Michael’s Tomato Soup and Maryland Blue Crab Cake; (Lynn described the tomato soup as “amazing”); Wolf – Smoked Salmon and Michael’s Ahi Tuna Tartare; Simma – American Fish Caesar and Maryland Blue Crab Cake; Ron – Michael’s Ahi Tuna Tartare and Wreckfish (firm meaty white fish basted in Herb Olive oil); Rita – Michael’s Ahi Tuna Tartare and Wreckfish; Jay – Michael’s Tomato Soup and Mustard-Marinated Black Cod; Julia – Shrimp & Grits and American Fish Caesar; Stan – Shrimp Gumbo and Michael’s Ahi Tuna Tartare; Debbie – Maryland Crab Cake and Small Shellfish platter (her request to substitute a couple of items was accommodated in a routine fashion); Mike - Octopus Lomi-Lomi and Mustard-Marinated Black Cod.
<br><br>
Rita also ordered Grilled Asparagus, Green Bean Casserole, and Gratin Tops (basked layers of crispy potato and parmesan) for the table.
<br><br>
For dessert, someone ordered plates of Beignets and various little cakes. 
<br><br>
Again the service was first rate.
