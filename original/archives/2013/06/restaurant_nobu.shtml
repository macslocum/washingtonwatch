The restaurant is very large, but broken up in a variety of ways. There are a number of round tables that seat up to ten people, most of which are in round alcoves. There is one alcove which has a half circle table, in the middle of which is the chef who prepares the dishes selected for the group. There are a variety of two, four and six-person tables. There is a long counter that faces one side of the open kitchen at which a full menu is served. There is also a long, traditional bar where drinks are served.
<br><br>
Noticing a young man at dinner with seven women at a nearby table, Jay decided to introduce himself. They invited him to pull up a chair and join them, which he did. It turns out that this was a bachelorette dinner for one of the young women, with the young man as the host.
<br><br>
The food comes out one dish at a time.
<br><br>
There was a lazy susan in the middle of the table on which various dishes were placed. Rita and Lynn chose most of the items which were shared by all. Their choices included Edamame, Shishito Peppers, Yellowtail Jalapeno; Tempura vegetables (beans, mushrooms); Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic and veggies; Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy Sauce, Rock Shrimp with Ponzu sauce; Jalapeno & Creamy Spicy Aioli; Black Cod Miso; Artichoke salad, Field greens with Masuhisa dressing, Kelp salad (aka seaweed); and Kampachi with salsa. Each of the dishes was very tasty, with interesting spices.
<br><br>
When filled, as it was the evening we were there, the restaurant is quite noisy, but if your table is in one of the alcoves it is easy to hear others in your party.
<br><br>
The men's room is large, but quite plain. There are two commode rooms with partial metal walls and doors; two wall-hanging urinals with a partial metal wall between them; and two white, ceramic washbasins in a marble counter top. The floor is covered with very large white tiles. The walls are covered with very large grey tiles, to about six feet, with white paint above.
