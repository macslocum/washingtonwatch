<h1>Jean Georges Steak House</h1>
Aria Hotel<br>
Las Vegas, Nevada</div>
Debbie and I were in Las Vegas with Jay and Rita, Wolf and Lynn, Stan and Julia, and Ron and Simma. Rita was our trip director, with periodic assists from Stan. We had dinner at the following three restaurants. None of these restaurants are inexpensive. Group lunches were at various of the more casual restaurants in the Aria Hotel.
<br><br>
Dress at the various restaurants was relatively casual, although at each there were folks who were more dressed up.

Through a certain amount of subterfuge Rita arranged for the group to get a perfectly-sized private room. The centerpiece of the room was two chandeliers, each of which were constructed of utensils, knives, forks, and spoons hanging from an oval frame.
<br><br>
As with a couple of other meals, one or more members of our group chose two appetizers/salads rather than an appetizer and an entree.
<br><br>
Wolf – Crispy Sushi Sampler, Tuna Tartare and Burrata Mozzarella ; Lynn – Crispy Sushi Sampler and Slowly Cooked Salmon; Rita – Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and New York Strip; Jay – Caesar Salad and Crunchy Baked Organic Chicken; Simma – Caesar Salad and Slowly Cooked Salmon; Ron – Caesar Salad and Wagyu Filet Mignon; Julia – Roasted Chilean Sea Bass and Sautéed Spinach; Stan – Colorado Lamb Chops; Debbie – Warm Spring Beets and New York Strip; Mike – Spring Pea Soup, Roasted Chilean Sea Bass, and Mashed Potatoes.
<br><br>
A variety of desserts were selected that were shared by all.
<br><br>
Wolf proclaimed all three dishes he ordered as excellent individually and in combination. Someone else in our party called the meal “fantastic.”
<br><br>
The restaurant offered one 6 oz steak for $270 but no one ordered it.
<br><br>
The service was attentive and in all other ways excellent.
<br><br>
The men’s’ room was quite interesting. As you enter there are three circular washbasins on individual stands in the middle of the room. To the right are two totally glass-enclosed commode rooms with colorful designs on the doors. To the left are two wall-hanging urinals with a partial wall between them. The commodes, urinals and washbasins are black ceramic. The walls are composed of relatively thin, multi-inch tiles in a variety of colors, including yellow, black, grey, green, and orange.
