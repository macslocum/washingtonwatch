</div>Debbie and I went with Tim and James to the East Ender for lunch. 
<br><br>
	As you enter the relatively small restaurant, straight ahead is a bar with five high stools. In addition to the bar there are 18 seats at 2tops and 4 tops. There is an upstairs room that has a bar with ten stools and additional seating for forty-six people. 
<br><br>
	Debbie started with the Local Chicken Liver Pate & Mushroom Crostini. I ordered the Smoked Hake Chowder which may well be the best I have ever eaten. We then shared the Maine Lobster Melt with Bacon Jam, Tomato & Peppadew Relish. 
<br><br>
	James selected the Grilled Escarole & Treviso with Poached Egg, Bottarga, Crouton, & Parmesan.
<br><br>
	Tim went for the Smokestack Lightning Burger with Monterey Jack, Shishitos & Steak Fries. 
<br><br>
	The restaurant is the final destination of a very popular food truck that operated in Portland.
<br><br>
	There are two gender neutral restrooms. I assume they are identical. There is a square white ceramic washbasin with an oval shaped mirror above it. There is a shelf next to the washbasin with dried flowers.  In the corner is a white ceramic commode. The floor is covered with wooden slats and the walls are a dark blue color. It is what you would call a very serviceable if not fancy facility.
<br><br>
	[If you would like more information about this restaurant, please see James Schwartz’s excellent review in the June 28, 2015 edition of the Portland Press Herald.]
