<h1>Casolare Ristorante & Bar</h1>
Glover Park Hotel<br>
2505 Wisconsin Avenue NW<br>
Washington, DC<br>
202-625-5400
</div>The Savoy Suites and a non-descript eatery has become the Casolare Ristorante & Bar.
<br><br>
	Opening less than six weeks ago, the Casolare has added a new dimension and then some to the eating opportunities in Glover Park.
<br><br>
	As you enter the restaurant, straight ahead is a reception desk. To the right is a long bar with about a dozen high stools. There are also some tables in this area.
<br><br>
	The principal dining room is to the left. To the far left is a series of four-person booths.
<br><br>
	There are banquettes with tables to the far right and mid-way into the room. In the main dining area there are two tops, four tops and six tops. The tables are square, oblong and round. There is considerable wood paneling on the posts, walls and ceiling and interesting lighting. There are a series of paintings on the walls that are apparently the work of the spouse of the owner of the restaurant.
<br><br>
	The restaurant can hold up to 154 people.
<br><br>
	Debbie and I went to Casolare with Ann and Len.  Ann and Len had been there before and were particularly positive.
<br><br>
	Ann ordered Mama Zecca’s Eggplant with Parmigiano and Polpette “A La Pugliese” with Spicy Tomato Sauce & Pine nuts (meatballs). She shared the meatballs with Debbie who also ordered a pasta, Maltagliati with Local Crab, Chiles and Green Onion.
 <br><br>
	Len started with a Classic Caesar Salad with Shaved Grana & Lace Croutons followed by Spicy Chicken “Alla Diavola”.
<br><br>
	I opted to begin with the Grilled Octopus with Potatoes, Scallion and Lemon followed by Giant Chicken Parm. 
<br><br>
	I was the only one who ordered dessert, an excellent Praline Gelato.
<br><br>
	Everyone was pleased with their choices. Both Debbie’s pasta and my chicken were of sufficient size that they made a second dinner. 
<br><br>
	Our server, as well as other personnel who interacted with us, were friendly, very well informed and quite accommodating. As the evening wore on our server was a little less attentive but that minor distraction will not discourage us from going to the restaurant in the future.
<br><br>
 Currently, the restaurant is only open for dinner but effective September 15th it will open for lunch.
<br><br>
	There is valet parking. When you leave the restaurant you have to go into the hotel lobby in order to pay for parking ($12.00, with taxes). The person behind the hotel desk calls the valet to have your car brought around. 
<br><br>
	We will return.
