<p></p>
WW has not heretofore recommended particular books and will rarely do so in the future. However, two quite different books have drawn my attention.
<br><br>
The first is the latest book by James Carville entitled, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016JPTIZ2">We’re Still Right/ They’re Still Wrong</a>.”  It is an interesting combination of facts, philosophy and James’s unique linguistic style.
<br><br>
	The second book is a collection of poems by Meghan Torpey, a friend of Will Cowan at Casa de Amma, a community of young adults living with disabilities. I found Meghan’s poetry quite special. 
<br><br>
	The collection is called, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Challenged-Flower-Meghan-Torpey/dp/0692726950">A Challenged Flower</a>” and the following is my favorite from the collection. It is called, “A Challenged Flower.”
<br><br>
<div align="center">
Most of us are like flowers<br>
Some of us grow short or tall<br>
Some of us bloom earlier than others.<br>
<br>
With support from our parents and<br>
Friends and special teachers<br>
We all blossom into individuals<br>
With colorful personalities<br>
We all have feelings and challenges,<br>
Some more than others.<br>
<br>
When I first found out I had a disability<br>
I got scared<br>
There were times when challenges,<br>
Teachers and bullies made me upset<br>
They labeled me.<br>
<br>
But at age six, I watched a show<br>
That changed my life.<br>
If a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle<br>
Can make it, I can make it!<br>
You are you!<br>
With a lot of hugs and some tears<br>
I managed to accept myself<br>
as the flower that I am.<br>
<br>
But a flower is not simple<br>
I am a poet, a writer, an artist<br>
a gamer, a reader and above all<br>
A good friend.

Both books are available on Amazon.com.
