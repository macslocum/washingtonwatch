<h2>Don’t be fooled by the BLS “headline” unemployment rate</h2>

The current ,widely publicized BLS unemployment rate of 5% does not represent reality. In any given month it is from 75-100% off.
<br><br>
When I have asked various media folks why they continue to use this number in their reporting rather than the real number, the only answer I get is that it allows comparisons to the past. The fact is that it is just as easy to compare the real unemployment rate to the past as it is to compare the rate that draws current attention.
<br><br>
There has been clear, substantial improvement in the amount of real unemployment over the last five to six years. However, for working people, the situation is not nearly as good as the official, widely reported number suggests.
<br><br>
First, let’s take a look at the “official” numbers.
<br><br>
The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for December 2015 is <strong>5%</strong>, the same as November.
<br><br>
In October 2009, the official unemployment rate was twice as high at 10%. In December of 2009, the unemployment rate was at 9.9%. In November 2010, the rate was still at 9.9%.
<br><br>
However, if one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is <strong>9.9%</strong>.
<br><br>
In October 2009 this more inclusive standard was <strong>17.1%</strong>. In December 2009 the rate remained at 17.1%. In November 2010 this figure was 16.9%.
<br><br>
Here is what is wrong with the so-called “headline” rate of 5%. Included in that rate are people who do not have a job, are available for a job, and <strong>have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks</strong>.
<br><br>
The broadest definition of unemployment includes everyone covered in the “headline” rate plus discouraged workers, marginally attached workers, and those who work part-time but would like to work full-time. [Marginally attached workers are those who “currently are neither working nor looking for work, but indicate that they want and are available for a job, and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months.”] At this time including these folks in the broader definition of unemployed increases the “headline” rate nearly 100% to 9.9%.
<br><br>
All of the data above is found in the same charts published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [Thanks to David Brown for the term “headline” rate.]

In the last week of November, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 5.6%. It also found an under-employment rate (unemployed +those working part-time but wanting full time) of 14.0%. [This is based on those 18 years of age and older. BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]

Both parties have lost confidence and trust in the public’s political wisdom.

<br><br>

<br><br>
62% of Republicans/lean Rep and 68% of Democrats/lean Dem believe that the “high cost of presidential campaigns discourages good candidates.” [Pew Research 12/7/15]

Much is being made of the schism in the Republican Party between the so- called establishment and the new conservative activists who resent the “insiders” who populate the leadership class represented by Washington.
<br><br>
Some believe that this situation creates an opportunity for the Democratic Party.
<br><br>
In fact, the Democratic Party is involved in the same conflict as the Republicans, except the challenge is coming from the left.
