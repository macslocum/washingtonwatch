<p></p>
The 2016 Presidential campaign may well be described as “never a dull moment.” The New York Times has reported that Michael Bloomberg is again considering an independent race for President. He has instructed his advisers to draw up plans for a campaign this year. According to the article, Bloomberg’s thinking is driven by the possibility that the final candidates will be Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. [NYT- on line – 1/23/16]
<br><br>
A top advisor to former Mayor Bloomberg had this to say, as reported in Mike Allen’s Playbook, on January 23. The former NYC Mayor “has become increasingly concerned about the tenor, tone and substance of both parties.”

<br>

The campaign will also be remembered by the rise and fall of Dr. Ben Carson.
<br><br>
Whether or not he ends up winning the Republican nomination and the White House, he will have changed the “rules” of Presidential campaigning.

By 46% to 43%, Americans would prefer that a Democrat be elected President. Roughly three-quarters of the Democrats and three-quarters of the Republicans feel strongly about their preferences.
<br><br>
When thinking about the coming election, 61% believe we should be looking for a President who will bring greater changes to current policies,
even if he or she is less experienced and tested. 36% opt for a person who is more experienced and tested.
<br><br>
33% of Republicans say they will vote in their State’s primary, while 27% of Democrats hold that view. This is the same number of Republicans that held this view last month. Among Democrats this is a drop from the 33% who held this position last month. [NBC/WSJ 1/13/16]

In the most recent NBC/WSJ survey (1/13/16) Republican and Democratic primary voters were asked how well each of several statements applies to them. They were asked to rate each one from 10 – 1. A score of 10 represents a description that is perfect for you and a score of 1 represents a description that is totally wrong for you. [WW has selected 4 statements which show up on both the list rated by Republicans and the list rated by Democrats.]

In his January 15th column, Charlie Cook offers a perspective on the current Republican contest. The following is an excerpt.
<br><br>
“Finally, there is the argument that has been made repeatedly in this column-that once these angry populists have finished venting their spleens, once they feel their voices have been heard, they will switch to a more plausible vehicle for their discontent, to a candidate that they could, in fact, envision in the White House Situation Room with a finger on the proverbial nuclear button, someone whose temperament and judgement might be on firmer ground.
<br><br>
“It is worth remembering that 94% of the 2,472 Republican convention delegates are not from the February states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada; these delegates are picked on or after March 1, and the winner-take-all States don’t come online until Florida and Ohio on March 15. Fifty-eight percent of delegates are picked in March, 16 percent in April, and 8 percent in May, with the final 12 percent in early June. It’s a long slog to the nomination.
<br><br>
“In short, take a deep breath and beware of talking heads behaving as if their hair is on fire. This process only starts beginning in three weeks with Iowa and doesn’t start in earnest until March 1.”

35% of registered voters think that Hillary Clinton would be a great (11%) or good (24%) President. 30% describe Bernie Sanders as a good President, with 11% describing him as great.
<br><br>
31% think Donald Trump would be a great or good President, and 28% think that about Ted Cruz.
<br><br>
At the opposite end of the spectrum, 28% think that Hillary Clinton would be a terrible President, while another 16% say she would be a poor President. 17% say Sanders would be a terrible President, while an additional 18% said he would be a poor President.
<br><br>
Trump takes the cake, with 38% saying he would be a terrible President and an additional 14% saying he would be a poor President, a total of 52%. [Pew 1/20/16]

<h2>4. Money raised and spent since September 30th</h2>

The amounts raised and spent will not be available until January 31, 2016.<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<h2>5. Primary/Caucus dates and state delegate numbers and allocation</h2>
<p>Included are the number of delegates assigned to each Party in each State and how the delegates will be allocated. The DNC mandates a proportional allocation for all States. The RNC allows States more flexibility. <br><br>
  Definitions for Republican Allocation of Delegates:
  <br><br>
  <em>Conv</em>: State will bind delegates to the national convention at a State/territory convention. Other conventions will leave the delegation unbound.
  <br><br>
  <em>Prop</em>: State will proportionally allocate delegates based either on the Statewide primary/caucus vote or on the combination of the Statewide and Congressional district votes.
  <br><br>
  <em>Prop w/ Trigger</em>: State will follow above proportional rules, but allows for a winner-take-all allocation if a candidate wins a majority of the vote Statewide or at the Congressional district level.
  <br><br>
  <em>Hybrid</em>: State will follow some form of winner-take-most plan (i.e., winner-take-all by Congressional district) or directly elects delegates on the primary ballot.
  <br><br>
  <em>Winner-take-all</em>: State will award all delegates to the plurality winner of the primary or caucus.

<h2>6. Presidential Primary Debates</h2>

<p><strong>Republicans</strong>
  <br><br>
The Republican National Committee is currently planning to sanction at least twelve Presidential primary debates. Six have already been held, in Ohio, California, Colorado, Wisconsin, Nevada, and South Carolina.
<br><br>
Trump, in response to his dustup at the previous Fox News debate, with Fox news anchor, Megyn Kelly, had threatened not to participate because she was to be one of the moderators of that debate. This was made more complicated by a news release distributed by Fox News. Trump then said he would not participate.
<br><br>
The Republican National Committee has decided to replace NBC with CNN as the moderator for the debate scheduled for February 26th. This is in response to CNBC’s performance at the October 28, 2015 debate. The date will be changed to February 25th.
