<h1>Char Bar & Eli’s Market</h1>
2142 L Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20037<br>
202-785-4314<br>
<a href="http://www.dccharbar.com">www.dccharbar.com</a><br>
Hours: Sunday-Thursday 11:00 a.m.-9:00 p.m. Friday 11:00 a.m. – 2:30 pm</div>For many years Eli’s Restaurant, located on 20th and N Street NW, was the primary kosher restaurant in Washington. A number of years ago I ate lunch there with Jacob.
<br><br>
In mid-2014, Eli’s relocated, and became Char Bar & Eli’s market. Recently, I had lunch at the Char Bar with Jacob and his sons Menachem and Yosef.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant there is a six person bar to your right. At the back of the restaurant there is a partially open kitchen.
 <br><br>
 The restaurant seats 75 people. The eating area of the restaurant is located on two levels. The lower level has a variety of table sizes. The upper level (a couple of feet above the lower level) wraps around two side of the lower level. It also has a variety of table sizes. We had a table designed to seat five.
 <br><br>
 There is a private room that appears to seat 11 people. Reservations are required.
<br><br>
Jacob and Menachem had Ribeye Steak – 16oz marinated, then grilled over flame, served with baked potato and chopped salad.
<br><br>
Josef selected Country Style Chicken and Steak Fajita – grilled vegetables, herb brown rice and beans, guacamole and pico de gallo.
<br><br>
I had a Caesar salad; the House Burger, plain with Lettuce and Tomato; and Hand-Cut Onion Rings.
<br><br>
It is fair to say that the portions are quite ample.
<br><br>
The service was quite attentive.
<br><br>
The restaurant offers a full catering service. There are limits to the addresses to which it will deliver. However, you can pick up an order. The menu is on the restaurant’s website.
<br><br>
Reservations are not accepted for lunch, but they are accepted for dinner and for use of the private room.
<br><br>
The Char Bar is affiliated with the Blue Star House of Beef, Burgers and BBQ in Rockville.
<br><br>
The Char Bar is under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Char Bar’s letter of certification can be found on its website.
<br><br>
The restaurant is closed from 2:30 p.m. on Friday until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.
