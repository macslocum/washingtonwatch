<h1>Nougatine at Jean-Georges</h1>
1 Central Park West<br>
New York, New York 10023<br>
212-299-3900</div>Jean-Georges is a more formal dining room than Nougatine, which is its more casual companion.  Debbie and I had lunch there with Bill and Robie. 
<br><br>
When we arrived at noon guests were not being allowed in the dining room even though we could see through the glass doors that folks were at tables. Bill asked about it and was told they were there having had breakfast. After about a ten minute wait the receptionists began letting folks into the dining room but we simply stood there. Then it became clear that as folks had arrived, many before us, they were placed on a list in order of their arrival and were being escorted into the dining room in the order in which they had arrived. Finally, it was our turn. 
<br><br>
As you enter through the doors there is a path to the more formal dining room.
<br><br>
The interior of the restaurant is quite modern. As you enter, there is an L shaped bar immediately to your right which seats twelve people on high chairs.  I suspect that on busy lunch days they also serve food. The rest of the room is filled with tables of various sizes, 2s and 4s. If there is a larger party, the various tables could easily be combined.  There is a long padded bench just past the bar with a number of two person tables. 
<br><br>
	Nougatine offers a pre-fix lunch menu Monday thru Saturday from noon to 3 p.m.
<br><br>
	Robie and Bill started with Kale Salad, Parmesan and Lemon. Debbie opted for the Beet and Strawberries Salad with Shallots, Chili, Sherry Vinegar, Pistachio and Mint. I went with Fried Calamari, Basil Salt and Citrus-chili Dip.
<br><br>
	None of us were particularly adventurous for our main courses. We all had the Cheeseburger with Russian Dressing and Crispy Onion. Robbie ordered it without the bun, Debbie and Bill ate the bun and I ate the bottom half of the bun, I had ordered my burger cooked medium well and Debbie requested medium rare. She got the  medium well and I got the medium rare so we just switched.
<br><br>
	Bill and Robie passed on dessert but Debbie and I couldn’t resist. Debbie ordered the Mixed Berry Pavlova, Whipped Fromage Blanc, Strawberry Sorbet. I selected the Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.
<br><br>
	While we did not try them the restaurant offers some interesting organic juices. Green Juice includes Apple, Kale, Cucumber, Spinach, Lemon and Ginger. Ruby Red Juice includes Carrot, Beet, Orange, Lemon and Young ginger.
<br><br>
	While Nougatine is quite casual, those in the more formal dining room seem to be less casually dressed.  Even at lunchtime the Nougatine enforces a business casual dress code which includes no sneakers, no shorts, no t-shirts and no flip flops. I was wearing a pair of Nike running shoes but no one commented or kept me out of the room. 
<br><br>
	The restaurant has four restrooms, two for women (unusual but smart), one for men and one joint for special needs.
<br><br>
	The individual restrooms are quite small. I only checked the men’s room but I suspect the two women’s restrooms are similar. There is a white ceramic commode and a white ceramic washbasin which is set in a square light swirled marble counter.  The walls are covered with a speckled light tan design.

<em>The Gift of Anger: Use Passion to Build Not Destroy</em>
<br><br>
By Joe Solmonese
<br><br>
The opening chapter is entitled, “Channeling Anger into Action.” Below are the opening lines of this chapter.
<br><br>
<blockquote>“These days the world seems to be an angrier place than it used to be. Let’s face it: we’re stretched in a million different directions, yet the world is getting smaller, more interconnected, and our relationships are rapidly changing. We used to compete against the business across the hall or across the country; now we must think about a global economy. Social media has provided a platform for anyone to express anything and everything they want and, democratically speaking, that’s a good thing.  Yet the sheer volume of  it, the unfiltered nature of the content, and the anonymity available on these platforms created echo chambers for anger and hurtfulness to be exacerbated."
</blockquote>
<br><br>
The book is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Anger-Passion-Build-Destroy/dp/1626565880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475799616&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Gift+of+Anger">Amazon</a>.

<h2>Women in Business</h2>

Women make up 47% of the total U.S. labor force.  They own nearly 9.1 million businesses which generate over $1.4 trillion in sales and employ nearly 7.9 million people.  Globally, women control close to $28 trillion in spending and generally control their home’s purse strings.  So why aren’t more women at the top of U.S. businesses?  
 <br><br>
Women make up only 4.8% of CEOs of S&P 500 companies, only 4.6% of Fortune 1000 CEOs and only 20% of board members for companies in the S&P 500.  While these numbers are an improvement over years past, they are not growing at a rate equal to the rate of women working in business, many of whom are capable of being industry leaders.
 <br><br>
The reasons for this lack of female leadership in business are multifaceted, but the research seems to bring two to the top: first, the idea that there aren’t enough women in the “pipeline” being trained and groomed for leadership positions and second, that gender bias continues to be pervasive in American business.  Women exit the pipeline for a myriad of reasons, but a common reason is work-family balance struggles.  
 <br><br>
There is little incentive for businesses to offer greater flexibility for women with families so, more often than not, women are forced to decide between the two.   One of the unintended consequences of women exiting the pipeline is that there are then fewer women to act as mentors to and advocates for up-and-coming female employees. Valuable guidance on how to best navigate the politics and competition of promotions disappears. It then becomes a bit of a chicken and egg situation; if women need greater female mentorship to get to higher positions but there aren’t any women to mentor them, how can they rise through the ranks to then become mentors themselves?  
 <br><br>
Another reason we see fewer women at the top, and one that seems to be a root problem, is gender biases.  Bias continues to permeate the business world and act as stumbling block for women pursuing business leadership.  A 2012 study found that “despite identical personal qualifications and firm financials, female CEOs were perceived as less capable than their male counterparts.”  
 <br><br>
Another recent study found that, “a female CEO who talked disproportionately longer than others in an organization setting was rated as significantly less competent and less suitable for leadership than a male CEO who talked for an equivalent amount of time.”  Expectations for men and women in the workplace are different when they shouldn’t be. 
 <br><br>
 Women have to prove themselves in ways that their male counterparts do not and this puts women at a disadvantage when it comes to moving up the ladder towards those leadership positions that so many of both strive and deserve to attain.  If business and society overcome gender bias and promote women who are qualified and capable to perform in top positions, the “pipeline” problem will disappear and women will be found in high numbers at every level of business, providing their talents and expertise to an essential American industry.  It is not a competency issue, it is an opportunity issue.

	The level of unfavorability of both candidates for president can’t help but draw attention. 
 <br><br>
	Hillary Clinton is viewed unfavorably by 55% of Americans while 43% view her favorably. Trump is viewed unfavorably by 59% of Americans and 39% view him favorably.
 <br><br>
	In January 2009, Clinton was viewed favorably by 66% of Americans while only 33% viewed her unfavorably. Her favorability eventually diminished until the spring of 2015. In March her favorability number went from positive to negative several times. By mid-May it had  turned negative for good. 
	 <br><br>
	Two things happened around that time. Clinton announced her candidacy for President and her use of a personal computer server for official business became known. 69% say Clinton did something wrong by using this server for her work as Secretary of State. [ CBS/NYT, 9/16]
 <br><br>
	The Real Clear Politics chart on the favorable/unfavorable ratings of Donald Trump start May 19-26, 2015. At that time, his unfavorable rating was 69% and his favorable rating was 20%. Between then and now, Trump’s unfavorable rating has ranged between 50% to 70%.

 <br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br> 
	60% of registered voters think Clinton is qualified to be president. Only 36% say that about Trump. When it comes to whether these two candidates are trustworthy, neither does very well. 35% say that Clinton is trustworthy and 31% have that view about Trump. [ABC/WP, 9/16] 

 <br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br> 
	The belief by women that Hillary Clinton is “judged more harshly because she is a woman”, varies by age. 60% of women age 18-29, 46% of women age 30-34, 38% of women age 45-64 and 31% of women 65+ hold this belief. [NYT/CBS, 9/16]

 <br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br> 
	The NBC/WSJ survey (9/16-19) asked respondents to rate the two candidates as to who is better suited to handle certain matters. On six of these matters, Clinton comes out ahead. On two of these matters, Trump comes out ahead and one quality they are tied.
 <br><br>
Dealing with the economy - Trump leads 46/41%<br>
Being honest and trustworthy- Trump leads 41/31%
 <br>
Terrorism and homeland security – Trump 43% , Clinton 42%
 <br>
Dealing with immigration – Clinton leads 50/39%<br>
Changing the country for the better – Clinton leads 44/38%<br>
Being a good commander-in-chief – Clinton leads 48/33%<br>
Being in charge of our nuclear weapons – Clinton leads 51/25%<br>
Having the right temperament to be president – Clinton leads 56/23%<br>
Being knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle  the presidency – Clinton leads 60/23%

The following are excerpts from Chris Cillizza’s October 3, 2016 column in the Washington Post entitled,  "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/its-all-about-the-heart-not-the-head-for-the-average-trump-supporter/2016/10/02/df61a56a-88b1-11e6-8a68-b4ce96c78e04_story.html">Trump supporters have fallen heart over head in love</a>"
 <br><br>
	“On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday, September 30th,  Chris Matthews gave the best explanation of what’s behind Trump’s appeal that I have heard during the entire election cycle. Here’s the key segment:
	 <br><br>
	“A lot of this support for Trump, with all his flaws, which he displays regularly, is about the country — patriotic feelings people have. They feel like the country has been let down. Our elite leaders on issues like immigration, they don’t regulate any immigration, it seems. They don’t regulate trade to our advantage, to the working man or working woman’s advantage. They take us into stupid wars. Their kids don’t fight, but our kids do.
	 <br><br>
	“It’s patriotic. They believe in their country. . . . [There is a] deep sense that the country is being taken away and betrayed. I think that is so deep with people that they’re looking at a guy who’s flawed as hell like Trump and at least it’s a way of saying, ‘I am really angry about the way the elite has treated my country.’ And it’s so deep that it overwhelms all the bad stuff from Trump. It’s that strong. It’s a strong force wind.”
	 <br><br>
	Chris continues, “So every time a newspaper advises against Trump, a <strong>celebrity says how dumb the candidate is</strong> or a <strong>member of the Republican foreign-policy establishment condemns him</strong>, it cements many people’s belief that what Trump has been saying all along is right. If the elites think that Trump is stupid or out of touch (or both), then those same elites think the same things about the average Joe. About you.
	 <br><br>
	“The resentment and anger those feelings fuel is why, at some level, it does not matter what Trump says or does. It is beside the point for many of these people. The point is that he is channeling all of their distaste for the state of the country — and the elites they think created it.
	 <br><br>
	“Those emotions are why Trump is still within shouting distance of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, despite his running one of the least-strategic campaigns in modern memory. And it is why he still has a shot at winning the election despite everything that he has done wrong over the past many months.
	 <br><br>
	“Matthews understands that in a way that few other people--and especially pundits--do.”

James Fallows posted the following on his <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/10/a-simple-way-to-think-about-the-election/502607/">daily blog on October 2nd</a>. It hits the spot. 
 <br><br>
<strong>A Simple Way to Think About the Election</strong>
 <br><br>
I think this is simple, rather than simplistic:
 <br><br>
1.	The people <em>who are for Donald Trump, are for him</em>. And almost nothing he can say or do, or that can be said or revealed about him, will undercut that support. The things that ordinarily would be considered “shocking” or “disqualifying” haven’t eroded belief among his base, and probably won’t.               
   <br><br>                                     
2.	But there are <em>not enough of these people</em> to get 270 electoral votes for Trump. There were enough to give him an initial plurality in a huge GOP field, and to keep him coming out ahead as his GOP rivals foolishly attacked one another rather than concentrating on him. But in the general election his core support has remained below winning levels in virtually all honest polls. He has so far seemed to hit a ceiling at around 40% support—sobering in itself, but not enough.
 <br><br>
3.	Therefore he <em>needs new supporters</em>—more women, more blacks and Latinos and Asians, more Muslims, more educated people, more of the young.
 <br><br>
4.	Therefore, the test of everything Trump does now—the debates, the “Miss Piggy” controversy, the taxes, everything—is whether it <em>brings him anyone new</em>. The question is not the one we mainly hear after debates or Trump flaps: how this affects his supporters. They already support him. The question is whether what he does and says brings in anyone undecided, or new.
 <br><br>
My guess is that it has not.
 <br><br>
The main point is: since Trump starts with <em>not enough votes to win</em>, the logical test to apply, in the 36 days that remain, is whether what he does with each speech, each answer in a debate, each tweet, each flux of the news cycle, expands his base. If it doesn’t, he has lost.

<h2>The Senate</h2>

Recent polling has the Republican ahead in Nevada, the Democrat ahead in Pennsylvania and the Democrat and Republican are even in New Hampshire. If New Hampshire breaks for the Republican and there are no surprises and races go as they are labeled below, the Republicans will control the Senate 51-49.  The data below is based on a combination of the current projections of Cook, Rothenberg/Gonzales and  Sabato, with a little bit of liberty on the part of WW.

	Let’s take a look at the “official” unemployment numbers.
<br><br>
The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September 2016 is 5.0%. 
<br><br>
	If one takes into account the total number of unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is 9.7%.  [BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]

<br><br>
	In the first week of October, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 5.4%. It also found an under-employment rate of 13.0% (unemployed + those working part-time but wanting full-time).  [This is based on those 18 years of age 
and older.] 
 <br><br>

	Real median household income increased by 5.2% between 2014 and 2015.
However, real median household income is still 1.6% lower than it was in 2007, the year before the most recent recession. 
<br><br>
	The official poverty rate in 2015 was 13.5%, down from 14.7% in 2014.
<br><br>
	However, there is a significant gender difference when it comes to the poverty rates. The poverty rate for women age 18-64 is 14.2% while for men it is 10.5%. [U.S. Census]

	Will wonders never cease? A number of major brands have informed their advertising agencies that failure to diversity their employee bases may cause the companies to take their business elsewhere. Most recently this group includes, Verizon, General Mills and HP, Inc. [NYT, 10/1]

<br><br>
	64% say that immigrants from other countries strengthen American society. 24% say they weaken society. [ABC/WP, 9/16]
<br><br>
	62% believe that illegal immigrants who are living in the U.S. should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship. An additional 12% think they should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally but not be able to apply for citizenship. [NYT/CBS, 9/16]

	On three issues in which religious liberty comes into conflict with the principle of non-discrimination, on only one does a majority of the public come down on the side of non-discrimination.
<br><br>
	67% believe that if an employer provides health insurance plans for its employees the coverage must include birth control. 30% should be able to include it on religious grounds. 
<br><br>
	51% believe that transgender people should be able to use the restrooms with which they currently identify. 46% believe that transgender people should be required to use the public restrooms of the gender into which they were born.	
<br><br>
	On the question of whether a business that provides wedding services such as catering and flowers must provide those services to same-sex couples, 48% believe that businesses should be able to refuse those services to same-sex couples while 49% say businesses should be required to provide such services to same-sex couples.[Pew Research Center, 9/28/16]

45% of us think the country is less great than in the past with 37% expressing a contrary view. 80% of registered voters who support Trump say the country is less great. This view is shared by only 20% of Clinton supporters.

	In September 2016, Gallup found that 32% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in the mass media. This is the lowest trust factor that Gallup has found since it started asking the question in 1997 and represents a drop of 8% points since last year. 
<br><br>
	There is a clear partisan distinction on how folks assess the mass media. 51% of Democrats have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media but only 14% of Republicans share that view. Only 30% of independents are found to be trusting of the media. 
<br><br>
	26% of people who are 18-49 years of age have a great deal/fair amount of trust in the media, a drop of 10% points in the last year.

		Whites 75%<br>
		Blacks 35%<br><br>
		
Holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs<br>
		Whites 70%<br>
		Blacks 31%
<br><br>
The number of people saying that protests of fatal police-black encounters are motivated by:
<br><br>
•	Long-standing bias against the police 79%  (41% a great deal, 38% some)
<br><br>

223 Columbus Avenue<br>

</div>We had dinner with David and Susan. David suggested the restaurant and made the reservation.
<br><br>
	Even several days in advance the only reservation available was at 5:30 p.m. When we arrived in a timely fashion the hostess confirmed our reservation and said that it would be a few minutes before they began seating people for dinner. There were a number of other dinner guests in the same situation and we stood together among a series of tables that are part of the bar area. 
<br><br>
	The dining room is straight ahead and quite long. It turns out that it is L- shaped and swings to the right at the end.  To the right of the entry is a very long bar with 20 high stools . The backs of the stools are covered and seem unusually comfortable. 
<br><br>
	Some large pillars divide the dining room and bar area but they are fairly far apart and the greenery between the pillars still allows one to see into the bar area from the dining tables. 
<br><br>
	Around the entire outside edge of the dining room there are a series of  rectangular booths with banquettes.  Most of these booths seat 4 people. The rest of the tables are 2s, 4s, and 6s.
<br><br>
	There are large windows on the outside walls so the room is quite open and airy. 
<br><br>
	Just after 5:30 p.m. a group of folks from the restaurant began taking the waiting parties to their tables. We were quickly seated.
<br><br>
	The main dining room seats 140 people, 40 more can be seated in the bar area and there is a private dining room that can accommodate 60 people.
<br><br>
	Even though the restaurant  is somewhat formal, the dress varied from business casual to more formal outfits for women and men.
<br><br>
	To begin the meal David ordered a thin crusted Tomato, Mozzarella & Oregano pizza for the table. It was quite large and could easily have served as an entrée.
<br><br>
	Susan also ordered Lambs Lettuce with Soft Goats Cheese and & Pecan Melba with Apple Cider Vinaigrette.  Feeling like having soup I ordered Heirloom  Squash Bisque “En Croute” with Rosemary Crème Fraiche & Toasted Pepitas. The puff pastry that topped the very large bowl of soup added something extra to what may have been the best soup I have every eaten in a restaurant.
<br><br>
	For her main course Debbie ordered Half whole roasted duck, & Wild Mushroom Risotto, Dried Wisconsin Cherry Gastrique. Susan ordered Mistral Linguine with Tiny Tomatoes, Arugula & Parmesan Reggiano.
<br><br>
	David selected Dover Sole Meuniere with Lemon & Capers, Sautee of Spinach & Onions,  Fingerling Potatoes.  I chose Pan Roasted Cornish Game Hen, Warm Pancetta & Spinach Salad, Lemon & Rosemary. 
<br><br>
	For dessert, Debbie ordered Profiteroles with Vanilla Ice Cream, Dark Chocolate Sauce & Pistachio Croquant. Susan chose the Warm Chocolate Torte, Vanilla  Ice Cream, Sauce Anglaise. I selected Crème Brulee, Raspberries & Palmier Twist. As a practical matter each of the desserts was shared around the table. 
<br><br>
	All of the portions were ample. The service was excellent.

	In the ordinary course I do not comment on the hostess or host at the reception desk. This is an exception. She always smiled and spoke nicely to ever single arriving guest at the top of the evening, those who had to wait for a few minutes. I noticed that throughout the evening she moved with deliberate speed to the end of the dining room and back, either seating other guests or what appeared to be checking to see what tables were still free and which guests were coming close to the end of their meals. Her performance was such that for the first time in any restaurant I made a point on the way out to comment to her about her work.
<br><br>
	The men’s room is new and quite large. There are two white ceramic commodes, and multiple white ceramic wall hanging urinals of different heights. The floor is covered with large tan tiles. There is a tan marble wall hanging table top with two white ceramic washing basins embedded.
 <br><br>
	Valet parking is available.

</div>Debbie and I went to this restaurant with Heather. Heather recommended that we try it especially because it was within a block of our hotel.
<br><br>
	The restaurant has two levels. To the right as you enter there is a with bar seating for about a dozen people and seating for 24 at tables. Both the dinner menu from the second floor and a separate bar menu are available.
<br><br>
	The stairs to the second floor would clearly have been beyond me but there is a perfect elevator that holds several people at a time.
<br><br>
	The second floor has another bar with seating for about a dozen and a variety of tables, 2,4s, and 6s, that seat 85 people. 
<br><br>
	When we arrived around 6:30 p.m. the restaurant was reasonably quiet. As the evening wore on and the number of diners and drinkers grew it became quite loud.
	<br><br>
	Our server came by several times but we were talking and frankly did not look at the menus. Debbie and Heather ordered some wine. I stuck with cranberry juice. 
	<br><br>
	Heather started with Foie Gras Terrine, pain au lait, strawberry gel. She followed with Olive Oil Poached Halibut, yellow piperade, tomato confit.
<br><br>
	Debbie did not order an appetizer but she managed a few mouthfuls of Heather’s Foie Gras. For her main course she ordered Bouillabaisse Du Midi, saffron-scented broth, rouille, gruyere.
<br><br>
	I selected the Spanish Octopus, fennel, capers, almonds, romesco. It was prepared with roasting whole tentacles, which I prefer rather than a series of cross sliced pieces. For my entree I picked the Monkfish, fegoa sarda, pine nut, capers, mushroom veal jus.
<br><br>
	I was the only one to order a dessert Chocolate Kahlua custard. Heather and Debbie did sample it.
<br><br>
	The restaurant offers three levels of tasting menus. There is a five course menu for $85 with a wine pairing that costs an additional $70. There is also a seven  course menu for $115 and a wine pairing  for an additional $85. Of course tip and taxes are additional.
<br><br>
	While our server checked in with us regularly and we did delay ordering so it was 9:30 before we were finished.
<br><br>
	On the way out I stopped at the men’s room which is located at the back of the first floor dining room. The rest room is nothing special. It is clean. There is a single white ceramic commode in a walled off area but there is no door. The same arrangement provides the location for a wall hanging white urinal. The walls are covered with medium yellow/brownish  tiles. The floor is a brownish cement like covering. There is a brownish marble shelf with two sunken white ceramic wash basins.

<h2>Women in Politics</h2>

Today, women hold more seats in Congress than ever before but this record number still only accounts for 20% of total seats.  Women comprise more than 50% of the general U.S. population, but only hold 25% of seats in state legislatures, 10% of governorships and 12% of mayoral seats for the nation’s 100 largest cities. 
<br><br>
	Women have proven their ability to govern and they are as likely to win races as men are, so the problem isn’t that women can’t win but that not enough women are running.
<br><br>
	Women face different challenges when considering a run for office.  Women are less likely to have been socialized to consider politics as a possible career path in the first place and most women don’t want to run for office simply because of the ugliness of politics.  Women have to deal with sexism and prejudices that can make the idea of running unappealing even to those who do have the desire—a population which is significantly smaller for woman than men.  Studies find a major gender gap when it comes to political ambition. Only 37% of women said they had considered running for office, compared to 57% of men. 
<br><br>
	Women often do not want their personal lives subjected to national discussion and many women don’t consider themselves as viable candidates, even if they have the right credentials.
<br><br>
	Once women do decide to run, if they win they still have distinctive challenges: 42% of female legislators disagreed with the statement “most men in my legislature are supportive of moving women into leadership positions” and 42% disagreed with the statement “the leaders in my legislature are as likely to consult with the women in their legislature as the men when making important decisions.” Politics is still very much an “old boys club” which can be both discouraging and counterproductive to women serving in government.
<br><br>
	Our State Houses and Capitols need to be filled with diverse legislatures that reflect the realities of the American citizenry.  With the challenges our government is tackling, it is time to take advantage of all of the talent and wisdom that both men and women can bring to the table.  To encourage more women to run for office, society must stop telling its young women that politics is not the place for them and then take advantage of the talents and experiences they bring once women do decide to enter the political arena.

The 2016 presidential campaign seems to have caused significant, relatively conservative groups to become much more tolerant of behavior which they have historically considered to be anathema. 	
	 <br><br>
	Since 2011, an increasing number of Americans have come to believe that a politician can be immoral in private and still perform their public duties in an ethical manner. The number supporting this point of view has grown from 44% to 61% since 2011. 
	 <br><br>
	The most significant change has come among white evangelicals. In 2011,
30% of white evangelicals believed that “personal immorality was consistent with an ethical performance of official duties.” That number has grown to 72%. 
	 <br><br>
	According to an article by Bill Galston, the only credible answer for this change is the candidacy of Donald Trump. [Brookings/Public Religion Research Institute]

Mitt Romney won the South by 7.1 points over Barack Obama in 2012. Donald Trump is winning in the South too, but by a mere 1.2 points. This is typified by Texas, where Donald Trump is leading by a rather slim margin for a Republican. A University of Houston poll has him up a mere 3 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

One of the best descriptions I have seen of the 2016 presidential election is a piece called “2016 Perspective” by Peter Hart. The following are excerpts from that piece. 
 <br><br>
“.... This is not just the story of the fall of one flawed candidate, but the story of an electorate that allowed him to rise and remain competitive throughout this 16-month quest.  He did nothing by the book; he ran what professionals may come to call “the worst campaign in the modern era of American politics.
   <br><br>
“The lens needs to refocus on the real subjects of this story--the voters. This story is about a year that allowed Donald J. Trump to exist.  It is about America today, complete with the anger and anti-Washington sentiment. An electorate fearful of domestic challenges–violence, race, the hollowing out of the middle class, and globally the fear from a war without borders or warning.  
 <br><br>
“To write the fall of Trump without acknowledging what allowed the rise of Trump and Sanders is to miss the point of the 2016 election.  Though we may chew up all the numbers and follow the entrails, this election was never the celebration of a new era or a new and triumphant commemoration of breaking the glass ceiling--it was about a nation trying to find some sense of equilibrium in a period of tremendous turmoil.  Donald Trump was a voice for the time, but a deeply flawed leader.  The American public never accepted him, but they were transfixed by him, and he touched the raw nerve of 2016.”

Charlie Cook wrote a column on October 6th entitled, “<a href="http://cookpolitical.com/story/10078">Elites shouldn’t ignore the lessons of 2016</a>”. The following is an excerpt.
 <br><br>

	“Elites can condescendingly view what is going on as political barbarians at the gate, the masses rising up with pitchforks to overthrow the establishment, but they are better off trying to understand why and address it while they can.
	 <br><br>
	“While Clinton’s inartful remark last month described half of Trump’s sup-porters as a “basketful of deplorables,” specifying them as “racist, sexist, homo-phobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it,” unfortunately the second part of her statement was largely ignored by the media. As transcribed by the Los Angeles Times: “But the other basket—and I know this because I see friends from all over America here—I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Caro-lina and Texas—as well as, you know, New York and California—but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they’re just desperate for change. It doesn’t really even matter where it comes from. They don’t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won’t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroin, feel like they’re in a dead end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.”
	 <br><br>
	“That’s pretty good advice for the political leadership to consider, both in this country and abroad. Elites around the world have grown out of touch with a large segment of the population, and it’s something that those in power should consider if they want to retain it.”

<h2>2016 General Election Debates</h2>


	Most commentators say that Hillary Clinton won the first debate, and by just about any standard she did. However, Donald Trump did speak to his followers who were watching.
<br><br>
	Pence was the clear winner of the vice-presidential debate. Someone obviously convinced Tim Kaine to be someone other than himself for this encounter.
<br><br>
	By all accounts, Clinton won the second debate.
	<br><br>
	The third debate started out as one of Trump’s best but that faded and Clinton was also the winner. 
<br><br>
	61% of likely voters believe that Hillary Clinton did the best job in the debates. Only 29% have that view of Donald Trump. [CNN/ORC 10/23]

<h2>The House</h2>

The Democrats continue on a path that is likely to result in an increase in their numbers in the House. However, current evidence is that the Presidential election is so far not having  any particular effect on the down ballot races. Therefore, the prospect of a Democratic takeover seems pretty dim.
<br><br>
	David Wasserman, the House editor of the Cook Political Report, estimates that the Democrats would have to win the national House popular vote by a least 8 points to win a majority. He notes that ,“while Democrats need a net gain of 30 seats in the House, there are currently only 37 competitive races, including six that are now held by Democrats.”

<h2>The Senate</h2>

If Clinton wins, a pickup of four Senate seats will allow the Democrats to control the operation of the Senate which will be split  50/50 between the Democrats + Independents and the Republicans.  A pickup of five seats gives them control without tying up the Vice President. 
<br><br>
 Based on the races up this year, actual control is not beyond the pale. 	
<br><br>
	It is quite likely that the number of female senators will increase with this election. The possibilities include Illinois, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Arizona.

Obama has an approval/disapproval rating on the economy of 47% to 47% and an approval/disapproval rating on foreign policy of 42% to 46%. [Economist/ YouGov, 10/8]
<br><br>
Peter Hart makes the point that Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton did little to help the person who was trying to succeed them. Obama is turning heaven and earth in support of Hillary Clinton.
<br><br>
	He also makes the case that Barack Obama has had the best 7th and 8th years of any president in his lifetime.

	The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September 2016 is 5.0% 
 <br><br>
	If one takes into account the total number of unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is 9.7%.  [BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]
 <br><br>
	In the fourth week of October, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 5.1%. It also found an under-employment rate of 12.9% (unemployed + those working part-time but wanting full-time).  [This is based on those 18 years of age and older.] 
 <br><br>
	Employment is rising faster in occupations requiring higher levels of preparation. [Pew Research, 10/6]
 <br><br>
	Alan Krueger, a Princeton professor and former chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, has looked at data prepared by Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer at the American Enterprise Institute, and arrived at the conclusion that large numbers of people in the prime of life are out of the work force because they are having health problems. Some are literally in considerable physical pain.
 <br><br>
	Fully 6 percent of American men between the ages of 25-54 and 5.8 percent of prime-age women say they can’t work because of health issues. This is a substantial increase since 1968. In the case of women it’s an increase from 1.8% and in the case of men, an increase from 1.6%. [WP, 10/13]
 <br><br>
	Here is data provided by Krueger about men who are not in the labor force as compared to unemployed men and working men.

Not surprisingly, 77% of those 18-34 years of age support legalization while only 45% of those over the age of 65 share that view. 70% of Independents, 67% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans support legalization.

<h2>“The Rules” are not “All the Rules”</h2>

We live in a world in which most everything we do is controlled by “formal” rules of one kind or another. Whatever our endeavor, significant or insignificant, large or small, complicated or easy, we know or learn the “formal” rules and we proceed. If we follow the “formal” rules we can have a reasonable expectation that what we do is permissible. 
 <br><br>
But now, knowing the “formal” rules and following them may not be good enough.
 <br><br>
	There is a new rule. It is called “perception”. 
 <br><br>
	Given the nature of communication today, in which anyone who has a beef can tell the “world”, in addition to whether something is legal and ethical, we must now consider how the activity looks.
 <br><br>
	For example, if a person is about to be selected to become part of the board of a charitable organization he or she must meet certain criteria, i.e. willingness to attend X number of meetings a year, raise a certain amount of money each year, etc. But if the person’s other activities are controversial, the charitable organization may decide that it does not want to take on the possible impact of the person’s reputation on their organization.

<h2>Death with Dignity</h2>

The following are excerpts from an Op-Ed by Bishop Desmond Tutu <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/archbishop-desmond-tutu-when-my-time-comes-i-want-the-option-of-an-assisted-death/2016/10/06/97c804f2-8a81-11e6-b24f-a7f89eb68887_story.html?utm_term=.46b7dbc755a3">published in the Washington Post.</a>
 <br><br>
“Throughout my life, I have been fortunate to have spent my time working for dignity for the living. I have campaigned passionately for people in my country and the world over to have their God-given rights. 
 <br><br>
	“Now, as I turn 85 Friday, with my life closer to its end than its beginning, I wish to help give people dignity in dying. Just as I have argued firmly for compassion and fairness in life, I believe that terminally ill people should be treated with the same compassion and fairness when it comes to their deaths…
 <br><br>
	“…In refusing dying people the right to die with dignity, we fail to demonstrate the compassion that lies at the heart of Christian values. I pray that politicians, lawmakers and religious leaders have the courage to support the choices terminally ill citizens make in departing Mother Earth. The time to act is now.”
