28% of Americans say the country is headed in the right direction while 66%  say it is on the wrong track. (Bloomberg, 9/24)

	Let’s take a look at the “official” unemployment numbers.
<br><br>
The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September 2016 is 5.0%. 
<br><br>
	If one takes into account the total number of unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is 9.7%.  [BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]

<br><br>
	In the first week of October, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 5.4%. It also found an under-employment rate of 13.0% (unemployed + those working part-time but wanting full-time).  [This is based on those 18 years of age 
and older.]

	Real median household income increased by 5.2% between 2014 and 2015.
However, real median household income is still 1.6% lower than it was in 2007, the year before the most recent recession. 
<br><br>
	The official poverty rate in 2015 was 13.5%, down from 14.7% in 2014.
<br><br>
	However, there is a significant gender difference when it comes to the poverty rates. The poverty rate for women age 18-64 is 14.2% while for men it is 10.5%. [U.S. Census]
