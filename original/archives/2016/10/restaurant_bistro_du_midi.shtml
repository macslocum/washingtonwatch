</div>Debbie and I went to this restaurant with Heather. Heather recommended that we try it especially because it was within a block of our hotel.
<br><br>
	The restaurant has two levels. To the right as you enter there is a with bar seating for about a dozen people and seating for 24 at tables. Both the dinner menu from the second floor and a separate bar menu are available.
<br><br>
	The stairs to the second floor would clearly have been beyond me but there is a perfect elevator that holds several people at a time.
<br><br>
	The second floor has another bar with seating for about a dozen and a variety of tables, 2,4s, and 6s, that seat 85 people. 
<br><br>
	When we arrived around 6:30 p.m. the restaurant was reasonably quiet. As the evening wore on and the number of diners and drinkers grew it became quite loud.
	<br><br>
	Our server came by several times but we were talking and frankly did not look at the menus. Debbie and Heather ordered some wine. I stuck with cranberry juice. 
	<br><br>
	Heather started with Foie Gras Terrine, pain au lait, strawberry gel. She followed with Olive Oil Poached Halibut, yellow piperade, tomato confit.
<br><br>
	Debbie did not order an appetizer but she managed a few mouthfuls of Heather’s Foie Gras. For her main course she ordered Bouillabaisse Du Midi, saffron-scented broth, rouille, gruyere.
<br><br>
	I selected the Spanish Octopus, fennel, capers, almonds, romesco. It was prepared with roasting whole tentacles, which I prefer rather than a series of cross sliced pieces. For my entree I picked the Monkfish, fegoa sarda, pine nut, capers, mushroom veal jus.
<br><br>
	I was the only one to order a dessert Chocolate Kahlua custard. Heather and Debbie did sample it.
<br><br>
	The restaurant offers three levels of tasting menus. There is a five course menu for $85 with a wine pairing that costs an additional $70. There is also a seven  course menu for $115 and a wine pairing  for an additional $85. Of course tip and taxes are additional.
<br><br>
	While our server checked in with us regularly and we did delay ordering so it was 9:30 before we were finished.
<br><br>
	On the way out I stopped at the men’s room which is located at the back of the first floor dining room. The rest room is nothing special. It is clean. There is a single white ceramic commode in a walled off area but there is no door. The same arrangement provides the location for a wall hanging white urinal. The walls are covered with medium yellow/brownish  tiles. The floor is a brownish cement like covering. There is a brownish marble shelf with two sunken white ceramic wash basins.
