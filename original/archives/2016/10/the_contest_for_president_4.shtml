The 2016 presidential campaign seems to have caused significant, relatively conservative groups to become much more tolerant of behavior which they have historically considered to be anathema. 	
	 <br><br>
	Since 2011, an increasing number of Americans have come to believe that a politician can be immoral in private and still perform their public duties in an ethical manner. The number supporting this point of view has grown from 44% to 61% since 2011. 
	 <br><br>
	The most significant change has come among white evangelicals. In 2011,
30% of white evangelicals believed that “personal immorality was consistent with an ethical performance of official duties.” That number has grown to 72%. 
	 <br><br>
	According to an article by Bill Galston, the only credible answer for this change is the candidacy of Donald Trump. [Brookings/Public Religion Research Institute]

Mitt Romney won the South by 7.1 points over Barack Obama in 2012. Donald Trump is winning in the South too, but by a mere 1.2 points. This is typified by Texas, where Donald Trump is leading by a rather slim margin for a Republican. A University of Houston poll has him up a mere 3 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

One of the best descriptions I have seen of the 2016 presidential election is a piece called “2016 Perspective” by Peter Hart. The following are excerpts from that piece. 
 <br><br>
“.... This is not just the story of the fall of one flawed candidate, but the story of an electorate that allowed him to rise and remain competitive throughout this 16-month quest.  He did nothing by the book; he ran what professionals may come to call “the worst campaign in the modern era of American politics.
   <br><br>
“The lens needs to refocus on the real subjects of this story--the voters. This story is about a year that allowed Donald J. Trump to exist.  It is about America today, complete with the anger and anti-Washington sentiment. An electorate fearful of domestic challenges–violence, race, the hollowing out of the middle class, and globally the fear from a war without borders or warning.  
 <br><br>
“To write the fall of Trump without acknowledging what allowed the rise of Trump and Sanders is to miss the point of the 2016 election.  Though we may chew up all the numbers and follow the entrails, this election was never the celebration of a new era or a new and triumphant commemoration of breaking the glass ceiling--it was about a nation trying to find some sense of equilibrium in a period of tremendous turmoil.  Donald Trump was a voice for the time, but a deeply flawed leader.  The American public never accepted him, but they were transfixed by him, and he touched the raw nerve of 2016.”

Charlie Cook wrote a column on October 6th entitled, “<a href="http://cookpolitical.com/story/10078">Elites shouldn’t ignore the lessons of 2016</a>”. The following is an excerpt.
 <br><br>

	“Elites can condescendingly view what is going on as political barbarians at the gate, the masses rising up with pitchforks to overthrow the establishment, but they are better off trying to understand why and address it while they can.
	 <br><br>
	“While Clinton’s inartful remark last month described half of Trump’s sup-porters as a “basketful of deplorables,” specifying them as “racist, sexist, homo-phobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it,” unfortunately the second part of her statement was largely ignored by the media. As transcribed by the Los Angeles Times: “But the other basket—and I know this because I see friends from all over America here—I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Caro-lina and Texas—as well as, you know, New York and California—but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they’re just desperate for change. It doesn’t really even matter where it comes from. They don’t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won’t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroin, feel like they’re in a dead end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.”
	 <br><br>
	“That’s pretty good advice for the political leadership to consider, both in this country and abroad. Elites around the world have grown out of touch with a large segment of the population, and it’s something that those in power should consider if they want to retain it.”

On October 18th, Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann made the point that even with all that has happened in the presidential campaign since the first of the year, the race has been relatively stable. Below is a comparison of the January 2016 NBC/WSJ and the October 10-13th NBC/WSJ survey.
<br><br>
•	Trump's fav/unfav rating in Jan. 2016: 29% positive, 58% negative<br>
•	Trump's fav/unfav now: 29% positive, 62% negative
<br><br>
•	Clinton's fav/unfav in Jan. 2016: 40% positive, 49% negative<br>
•	Clinton's fav/unfav now: 40% positive, 50% negative
<br><br>
•	The two-way ballot in Jan. 2016: Clinton 51%, Trump 41%<br>

<h2>2016 General Election Debates</h2>


	Most commentators say that Hillary Clinton won the first debate, and by just about any standard she did. However, Donald Trump did speak to his followers who were watching.
<br><br>
	Pence was the clear winner of the vice-presidential debate. Someone obviously convinced Tim Kaine to be someone other than himself for this encounter.
<br><br>
	By all accounts, Clinton won the second debate.
	<br><br>
	The third debate started out as one of Trump’s best but that faded and Clinton was also the winner. 
<br><br>
	61% of likely voters believe that Hillary Clinton did the best job in the debates. Only 29% have that view of Donald Trump. [CNN/ORC 10/23]
