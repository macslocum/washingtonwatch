<h1>Tartufo Restaurant</h1>
4910 Wisconsin Avenue, NW<br>
Washington DC 20016<br>
240-624-9510</div>This recent addition to the D.C. restaurant scene was opened by the former maitre’D at DiCarlo’s Restaurant. We went there with Rita and Bob.
<br><br>
You enter in an area of the restaurant that is an extension at the front of the restaurant. The restaurant seats roughly sixty-five. The size of the tables ranged from two to four to five to ten on the night we were there. Except for one table seating five people, every other table is composed by combining tables for two.
<br><br>
	  There is seating for up to twenty-seven people in the front extension. The main dining room is on the same level. An additional thirty seven people can be seated there. 
<br><br>
	At the far end of the room there is a bar which has three large stools and behind the bar is the kitchen.
 <br><br>
Rita had a Caesar salad and Salmone Pescatore – Salmon baked in white wine lemon, herbs with mussels, clams and shrimp. Debbie had a Caesar salad and a soft shell crab. Bob had Caesar salad and spaghetti with tomato sauce and mushrooms. Mike had Calamari Fritti and Tagliatelle al Ragu. There was also a second order of Calamari Fritti for the table.
<br><br>
For dessert, Rita, Debbie and Bob had peach and coconut sorbet and I had Tartufata, Chocolate Truffle Mousse.
<br><br>
The restrooms are up a very steep set of stairs to the second floor. There will be no review of the restrooms.
<br><br>
	The service was quite good. Although Bob had to ask several people in order to get some butter. 
<br><br>
	The restaurant is open seven days a week and it is organized for takeout. Parking is on the street. The night we were there Bob had to park about a block away. 
<br><br>
It is worth a second visit.
