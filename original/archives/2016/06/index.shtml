<h1>Tartufo Restaurant</h1>
4910 Wisconsin Avenue, NW<br>
Washington DC 20016<br>
240-624-9510</div>This recent addition to the D.C. restaurant scene was opened by the former maitre’D at DiCarlo’s Restaurant. We went there with Rita and Bob.
<br><br>
You enter in an area of the restaurant that is an extension at the front of the restaurant. The restaurant seats roughly sixty-five. The size of the tables ranged from two to four to five to ten on the night we were there. Except for one table seating five people, every other table is composed by combining tables for two.
<br><br>
	  There is seating for up to twenty-seven people in the front extension. The main dining room is on the same level. An additional thirty seven people can be seated there. 
<br><br>
	At the far end of the room there is a bar which has three large stools and behind the bar is the kitchen.
 <br><br>
Rita had a Caesar salad and Salmone Pescatore – Salmon baked in white wine lemon, herbs with mussels, clams and shrimp. Debbie had a Caesar salad and a soft shell crab. Bob had Caesar salad and spaghetti with tomato sauce and mushrooms. Mike had Calamari Fritti and Tagliatelle al Ragu. There was also a second order of Calamari Fritti for the table.
<br><br>
For dessert, Rita, Debbie and Bob had peach and coconut sorbet and I had Tartufata, Chocolate Truffle Mousse.
<br><br>
The restrooms are up a very steep set of stairs to the second floor. There will be no review of the restrooms.
<br><br>
	The service was quite good. Although Bob had to ask several people in order to get some butter. 
<br><br>
	The restaurant is open seven days a week and it is organized for takeout. Parking is on the street. The night we were there Bob had to park about a block away. 
<br><br>
It is worth a second visit.
<br><br>

<h1>Pesce</h1>
2002 P Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20036<br>
202-466-3474</div>Debbie and I went to Pesce for the first time with Bev and Brady.  Frankly, as many times as I have driven down “P” Street I’ve never noticed the restaurant even though it has been on this block for 20 years. 
<br><br>
There are four steps up to the main restaurant level. The restaurant is longer than it is wide and seats 75 people including 10 people at the bar. The bar sits about two-thirds of the way back into the restaurant and includes many 2s and 4s. 
<br><br>
Even when full of diners you can still have a conversation without shouting and without sharing it with the next table. 
<br><br>
Pesce is primarily a seafood restaurant which offers a full range of seafood from sardines to octopus to tuna to salmon. There is also a selection of salads and at least one soup a night. 
<br><br>
The menus are hand-written each day and presented table side on chalkboards. The offerings vary from time to time. The night we were there a veal chop was on the menu.
<br><br>
Bev started with a Caesar salad followed by Lobster Risotto. Debbie started with Tuna Tartare followed by Pasta with Clams. Brady had Oysters on the ½ shell followed by the Veal Tonatto (a veal chop topped with tuna tonatto). I started with the grilled Calamari followed by a grilled Lobster. 
<br><br>
For dessert we shared a Chocolate Tart and Pecan and Apple Tart.
<br><br>
There is something about the atmosphere of the restaurant that makes it quite comfortable and friendly.
<br><br>
About the men’s room, it is located at the back of the restaurant across from the women’s room. The two rooms are about five steps up from the main restaurant floor. There is a sign posted on the men’s room door that says “Dear Patron, Men’s room doorknob does not lock. Please lock latch behind you. Thank You management.” The door is easily latched from inside.
 <br><br>
Immediately to the right is a wash basin in a tan marble top.  The floor is a series of black and white squares and rectangles. The walls are covered with square tan tiles several inches wide.
<br><br>
There is a standard white ceramic commode and, interestingly, there is a table with a white cloth straddling the urinal. My assumption was that it is not operable. The men’s room is generally a bit run down but clean enough. 
 <br><br>
Valet parking is available in the evening. The valets also services Al Tiramisu.
<br><br>
Hours: 11:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. (10:30 p.m. on Fri & Sat)

<h1>Pennsylvania 6 </h1>
1350 I Street NW<br>
Washington, D.C. <br>
202-796-1600<br>
<a href="http://www.pennsylvania6dc.com">www.pennsylvania6dc.com</a></div>I have been to Pennsylvania 6 three times. The third time was to see whether the experience of the second time was an aberration.
<br><br>
	The restaurant gets its name from New York’s historic Hotel Pennsylvania.
<br><br>
As you enter the restaurant, to the right is a large u-shaped bar with multiple stools. To the right of the bar is a long table just shy of the length of the side of the bar.  The table is higher than the other tables in the restaurant and includes high chairs all the way around. During my two evening visits that area seems to be a gathering place for a generally younger set.
<br><br>
	Right behind the host desk there is a circular room that seats 6-8 people.
<br><br>
	When fully occupied, the restaurant can seat 250 people in six rooms. Based on the size of the crowd the restaurant can close off or simply not seat folks in various rooms.  There are a variety of two, four and six tops as well as banquette backed tables of two and four.
 <br><br>
	The décor is fairly heavy with much wood paneling and depending on the room there are a variety of pictures on the walls. There is also a sitting room where you can relax, and I assume, have a drink. Overall, the décor is quite warm and inviting, and the dining chairs are quite comfortable.
 <br><br>
	For our first dinner we were seated in the largest room. For the second dinner and lunch we were in an area that is adjacent to the bar.
 <br><br>
	On the first visit, Debbie and I had dinner with Sherry and Decker.
 <br><br>
     Sherry and Debbie started with Caesar salads and Decker and Mike selected Roasted beets.
<br><br>
     For entrees, Sherry selected Scallops and Debbie went with the Lobster Roll. Decker chose Yellowfin Tuna and I tried the Monkfish Osso Buco. We also ordered Sardinian Flatbread for the table.
<br><br>
	The desserts we ordered for the table were Bolivian Chocolate Terrine with caramelized bananas, peanut brittle, chocolate ganache sauce and expelette chili pepper <em>and</em> Mini Crème Brulees – with bourbon – vanilla, spiced pumpkin, dark chocolate-coffee.
<br><br>
	The service was everything you would want it to be. Overall it was a perfectly pleasant experience.
<br><br>
	Our second visit was on a Sunday night. Debbie and I were joined by Heather and Jim.
<br><br>
	The number of diners was quite small. The room in which we had our first dinner was not being used. We were seated in an area near the bar.
<br><br>
	Everything went well at the outset. Our server was attentive and happy to answer questions about the restaurant and the menu.
<br><br>
	Heather ordered Louisiana Fried Oysters, with hot & sour sauce, herb aioli and lemon wedge and PE6 Market Salad. Debbie again ordered the Lobster Roll. Jim ordered a New York Sirloin. I ordered Crab Croquettes, sweet potato and again the Monkfish Osso Bucco. 
<br><br>
	Dinner was slow. It was as if when additional diners arrived and were seated there were not enough personnel on the floor or in the kitchen. Jim’s steak was not cooked as he had requested and had to be returned. 
<br><br>
	And then the service deteriorated. There was a delay in taking our dessert order and then when we tried to get our bill it was also difficult. 
<br><br>
	Our problems may have become obvious because the manager came over and cut our bill.
<br><br>
	My third visit was lunch with Ruth. Our server was Chris and the service left nothing to be desired. Ruth ordered Seared Tuna Sashimi and I again ordered Crab Croquettes again and a Seafood Louis. For dessert I ordered the Bread and Butter pudding of which Ruth also partook. 
<br><br>
Ruth asked if they had mixed fruit which was not on the menu. The server said he would check and quickly returned to report that it would be available but also noted the price which seemed a bit high. 
<br><br>
	 The food was quite good on all three visits which caused me to twice order Monkfish, a favorite of mine that is only selectively available in D.C restaurants. Debbie enjoyed the Lobster Roll enough to also order it twice.
<br><br>
I concluded that the second visit was an aberration and I will be going there again.
	 <br><br>
	The men’s room is as fresh as the restaurant. There are two long form urinals, side by side. There is a single fully enclosed commode room and a wash basin in a white marble top. 
<br><br>
Valet parking is available Monday – Saturday nights. When I made the reservation I asked whether there was valet parking on Sunday. The person said that it was not available on Sunday night but noted there is often street parking and there is an open garage about a block away. We were able to park on the street.

                                 	Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for president on May 4, 2016. He had not yet secured the required 1,237 votes but all of the other 16 candidates had dropped out of the race. He has since surpassed the magic number.
<br><br>
	Hillary Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 6, 2016 when the AP reported its analysis of pledged delegates and super delegates. Clinton had reached the magic 2,382 delegates. This number includes 1,812 pledged delegates and 572 super delegates. On this same date in 2008 Clinton ended her campaign against Barack Obama.
<br><br>
	Clinton has made history as the first woman nominated for president by a major political party. 
	<br><br>
	On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on May 16th, Republican consultant Steve Schmidt made the case that these are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in history. 
<br><br>
	Bernie Sanders, the man who spent his political career describing himself as a socialist while caucusing with the Democrats, is apparently ending his campaign with the same grace that Hillary Clinton did in 2008. He is vowing as he did on June 9th to work with Hillary Clinton to defeat Donald Trump in November. He made his pledge on the same day that President Obama and Vice President Biden formally endorsed Clinton for President. 
<br><br>
	When Sanders announced his candidacy for President on April 30, 2015, no one thought he would accomplish as much as he has in challenging Hillary Clinton. 
<br><br>
	During the course of the campaign (through April 2016) Sanders raised slightly more money for his personal campaign committee than Clinton did for hers, $212 million to $211 million. He appears to have accomplished this without taking any contributions from PACs.
<br><br>
 In the months of January through April of 2016, Sanders raised more money than Clinton. By the end of April the Sanders campaign had taken in more than 7.4 million contributions from more than 2.4 million donors. While the campaign claims that the average contribution received is $27, which is probably an exaggeration. WW’s calculation is that the average donor has given just under $90. Some contributors have given the maximum of $2,700.

The Trump campaign claims it will ultimately convert these loans to a candidate contribution. As of April 30th the conversion was not made. As long as it is listed as a loan it could be paid back by Trump at least through the end of the primary season.

The Clinton campaign has started to actively solicit general election contributions.

  <h2>6. The Conventions</h2>
  
  	For quite some time the working assumption was that the Republican convention would include considerable fireworks while the Democratic convention would be relatively calm.
<br><br>
	It now appears that both conventions could be entertaining but for different reasons.  For the Republicans there could well be tensions relating to the public postures of its presumptive nominee. In the case of the Democrats there could well be tension around the question of how far left the party’s platform will go.
<br><br>
Republicans: July 18-21, Cleveland, Ohio
<br><br>
	Democrats: July 25-28, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
<br><br>
At both conventions there will be efforts made to change the rules under which the nominating process will be conducted.
<br><br>
<strong>The Republicans</strong>
<br><br>
	The four states that voted first in the current cycle may not retain their place on the electoral calendar. Their position may be diluted by the addition of states being added to their position on the calendar. The state of Nevada is the most threatened.
<br><br>
	An argument will be made to limit participation in the primaries and caucuses to registered Republicans only and close the proceedings to Independents.
<br><br>
	Another proposal is to have a different set of states go first in each presidential nominating cycle.
<br><br>
<strong>The Democrats</strong>
<br><br>
	Consideration will be given to a change in the primary calendar. While there are few serious problems, one proposal will be to move the four states that start the primary seasons on to a single day so that all parts of the country will have an early say.
<br><br>
	The issue that will get the most attention is that of the role of Super Delegates.  

<br><br>
<hr color="#dddddd" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<br>

The following are a couple of pieces about Super Delegates.

<h2>The History of Super Delegates</h2>
<blockquote>
"The Democratic Party created its firewall of “ex-officio delegates” as a hedge against the kind of electoral disaster the party suffered in 1972 when candidate George McGovern lost in a landslide.
<br><br>
McGovern had won the nomination in a grassroots uprising energized by opposition to the Vietnam War and social movements for civil rights and women’s rights. Republicans dubbed him the candidate of “amnesty, abortion, and acid”. At the Democratic Convention in Miami, divisions in the party were highlighted when McGovern ousted Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, once the consummate powerbroker, seating instead an Illinois delegation headed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
<br><br>
In the wake of McGovern’s historic defeat, the Democratic Party bigwigs shunned in Miami looked for a way to regain some of their lost influence. Three blue-ribbon commissions followed before a compromise was struck between liberal reformers, who wanted zero party officials as delegates, and state chairs and party officials who wanted 25 percent representation.
In the current cycle, there are 715 supers out of 4,765 total delegates. Of the supers, 473 are pledged to Hillary Clinton, 32 to Bernie Sanders, and 1 to Martin O’Malley, who left the race after Iowa. The rest, 209, are uncommitted.
<br><br>
Ideally, the super delegates affirm the will of the people, moving in large numbers toward the candidate who receives the most votes in the party’s primaries and caucuses. That’s the argument that Tad Devine, now working for Sanders, made in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/opinion/10devine.html?_r=0">2008 op-ed</a> recalling how worried he was as Walter Mondale’s delegate counter in 1984 when he realized the morning after the last primaries that they were 40 delegates short of a majority. After a frantic round of phone calls, the supers put Mondale over the top by noon.
<br><br>
Devine made the point in his article that this mass of uncommitted convention voters “should resist the impulse and pressure to decide the nomination before the voters have had their say.”
<br><br>
Who are these super delegates? They are major elected officials (including senators and members of the House of Representatives), notable party members (current or former presidents and vice presidents) and some members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)—put simply, the Democratic elite. After 1968, the Democrats produced some relatively weak nominees: George McGovern carried only one state, plus the District of Columbia, in his loss to Richard Nixon in 1972, and in 1980 Jimmy Carter lost reelection to Ronald Reagan by only a slightly less humiliating margin. In the wake of such losses, leading Democrats decided to reform the nominating process so that the party’s elite members could play more of a role in selecting nominees, and choose candidates they believed would fare better in the general election. 
Theoretically, super delegates could change the results of a nominating process, but in practice they rarely have. Since the reforms were adopted in 1982, all super delegates have followed the results of the popular vote in the primaries at the convention. The only time super delegates directly exerted their influence was in 1984, when they pushed Walter Mondale to the nomination after he won the pledged delegate count by too narrow a margin to secure victory. (Mondale would win.)"

</blockquote>
<br><br>
[WW note: There is an important reason for the creation of Super Delegates that is not mentioned above. It was the desire of many public officials to avoid having to run against their constituents for convention delegate’s status.]

<blockquote>
“… nominations are party business. It’s not a public race. Political parties are not in the Constitution, but they are protected by the First Amendment’s right of free association. There’s no constitutional guarantee that you can participate in the activity of a party. They’re a funny, semi-public organization. And for most of history, super delegates were the only ones picking nominees. You couldn’t go to a convention unless you had some kind of tie to the party, either being elected on its ticket or worked really hard in the party. The notion that voters would pick the nominee was foreign all the way from 1831 to 1972. And in most democracies in the world, voters don’t get to choose the nominee of the party. Because this has become such a public process here, people have forgotten that, in the end, the parties get to decide who is a Democrat and who is a Republican."

<h2>About Polling</h2>

The following is an excerpt from an article by Norman Orenstein and Alan Abramowitz in the New York Times:
<blockquote>
“The demographic composition of the American electorate is changing rapidly, becoming more racially diverse with every election cycle, and these changes are most evident among the youngest generation of voters. Because there is a deep racial and generational divide between the parties, underrepresenting younger voters and racial minorities can seriously bias poll results. This problem is likely to be exacerbated by the presence at the top of the Republican ticket of Mr. Trump, whose electoral strategy is based on appealing to older white voters.
<br><br>
“At the same time, we have no strong sense of how to sort out likely voters from nonvoters when a relentlessly negative campaign can frighten people into voting or depress them into staying home.
<br><br>
“Smart analysts are working to sort out distorting effects of questions and poll design. In the meantime, voters and analysts alike should beware of polls that show implausible, eye-catching results. Look for polling averages and use gold-standard surveys, like Pew. Everyone needs to be better at reading polls — to first look deeper into the quality and nature of a poll before assessing the results.” [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/opinion/stop-the-polling-insanity.html">NYT 5/20/16</a>]</blockquote>

In the June 2nd edition of the FiveThirtyEight Newsletter, Nate Silver published their rating of pollsters. The ratings are “calculated by analyzing the historical accuracy and the methodology of each firm’s polls on an A, B, C, D, and F scale.”  The ratings are regularly updated.  The results are included in an article entitled “The State of The Polls, 2016”.
<br><br>
The analysis done by Five Thirty Eight is based on various numbers of polls, spanning from 782 for Survey USA to a single poll for a variety of entities. The list is ordered from the highest to the lowest number of polls analyzed. The following pollsters with 25 or more polls analyzed received grades of A+ to B+.

	First, let’s take a look at the “official” unemployment numbers.
<br><br>
	The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for May 2016 is <strong>4.7%</strong>, up from 5.0% last month. Unfortunately, this is not good news. The rise is the result of a half million fewer people looking for work.
<br><br>
	If one takes into account the total number of unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is <strong>9.7%</strong>.  [BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]
<br><br>
	There is some additional bad news. The number of jobs created in May was only 38,000 (not adjusted). This compares with an average of 228,600 jobs created in each month in 2015 and an average of 182,000 jobs created in the first four months of 2016. 
	<br><br>
	In the first week of June, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of <strong>5.5%</strong>.  It also found an under-employment rate (unemployed + those working part-time but wanting full time) of <strong>13.7%</strong>.  [This is based on those 18 years of age and older.]

“The birthrate among American teenagers has fallen to an all-time low,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The birthrate was 61.8 births per 1,000 in 1991, the peak year. In 2014, the birthrate was 24.2 births per 1,000, a 60% drop. This was the lowest birthrate in history.  [WP 4/29/16]

The number of people going to law school has dropped precipitously since 2006. In that year there were 88,000 admissions at U.S. Law Schools. In 2015 there were 51,000 admissions. Only 60% of 2015 law schools graduates were employed in the legal industry ten months after graduation. However, those who do find jobs, especially in major law firms, can make as much as $180,000 per year.

The following is an <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2016/05/27-unhappiness-in-america-graham">excerpt from an article by Carol Graham in Brookings Brief</a>.
<blockquote>
	“My research finds deep divisions in our country—not just in terms of income and opportunity, but in terms of hopes and dreams. The highest costs of being poor in the U.S. are not in the form of material goods or basic services, as in developing countries, but in the form of unhappiness, stress, and lack of hope. What is most surprising, though, is that the most desperate groups are not minorities who have traditionally been discriminated against, but poor and near-poor whites. And of all racial groups in poverty, blacks are the most optimistic about their futures. 
	<br><br>
“Based on a question in a Gallup survey asking respondents where they expected their life satisfaction to be in five years (on a 0-10 point scale), I find that among the poor, the group that scores the highest is poor blacks. The least optimistic group by far is poor whites. The average score of poor blacks is large enough to eliminate the difference in optimism about the future between being poor and being middle class (e.g. removing the large negative effect of poverty), and they are almost three times more likely to be higher up on the optimism scale than are poor whites. Poor Hispanics are also more optimistic than poor whites, but the gaps between their scores are not as large as those between blacks and whites.” [Brookings Brief, May 27, 2016]

	In no presidential campaign to date has the internet played a larger role than it is playing in 2016. 
<br><br>
Certainly the internet played a big part in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, primarily as an organization and fundraising tool. But today with the cooperation of the traditional TV and cable media, Donald Trump has set a new standard with his use of Twitter. And while it is an old fashioned form of communication he has also succeeded in getting the media to treat him as if he was in their studios by calling in and having his voice and message carried live.
<br><br>
	An item in the FiveThirtyEight Significant Digits newsletter, originally published in the Financial Times, produced a PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast stating that next year web advertising  will hit $75.3 billion compared to an estimated $70.4 billion in advertising revenues for traditional television broadcasters.

The Baby Boom generation (age in 2016) – 52-70 years<br>
The Silent and Greatest generations (age in 2016) – 71 years and older		<br>
<br>
Millennials are now roughly equal to the Boomers as the largest generation. 
<br><br>
Millennials – 75 million<br>
Baby Boomers – 75 million<br>
Generation X – 66 million<br>
Silent – 28 million<br>

<h2>Women in America</h2>

According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, the male/female wage gap significantly widened for young workers in 2015. Young female college graduates received paychecks that were about “79% as large as those received by their male counterparts”. This is a drop from 84% the year before.  In 2000, female graduates received 92% of their male counterparts.

In dollar terms this results in an annual difference of $9,000 between young men and young women. [WP 4/29/16]

<h2>Girls Beat Boys in Eighth-Grade Tech, Engineering Literacy Tests: Survey</h2>

By Erik Ortiz 
<br><br>
<blockquote>
American eighth-grade girls on average scored better than their male peers in technology and engineering literacy tests, according to a national report card released Tuesday. 
<br><br>
Girls scored three points higher than boys overall — a reversal of gender expectations because boys typically score higher than girls in math and science testing, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
<br><br>
American girls, however, have already been gaining ground in those subjects in recent years, the organization said. 
<br><br>
The findings of this latest test — the first ever of its kind administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2014 — provide a snapshot of how well American students are versed in an era of rapidly changing technologies. 
Female students also did better than males when the questions were related to communication and collaboration (five points higher) and information and communication technology (six points higher). 
<br><br>
"It is clear that girls have the abilities and critical thinking skills to succeed in tech and engineering," said Peggy Carr, acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and analyzes education data under the federal government. 
<br><br>
Forty-five percent of girls scored proficient or better on the test — compared to 42 percent of boys. 	[NBCNews.com May 17, 2016]

<h2>Transgender in America</h2>

	The rights of transgender people, folks who do not identify with their birth gender, are now under assault in various parts of the country. The issue of the moment is the right of a person who does not identify with their birth gender to use a restroom designated for people of the gender for which they now identify. 
<br><br>
	In general, 33% of registered voters say that we have gone too far in the way we deal with transgender people. A year ago only 24% thought we have gone too far. 33% say we have not gone far enough, about the same number as a year ago. 28% say we have now reached a reasonable balance which is less than the 34% who had that view a year ago. 
<br><br>
	In April 2015 when asked the same question about homosexuality generally only 20% said society had gone too far, 44% said we have not gone far enough and 32% said we have reached a reasonable balance.
<br><br>
	North Carolina recently passed a law that prevents transgender people from using public restrooms that match the gender with which they identify and requires them to use public restrooms based on their gender at birth. 
<br><br>
	40% agree that transgender people should be allowed to use the public restroom of the gender with which they identify. 31% say transgender people should be legally prevented from doing so. 
<br><br>
	The U.S. Department of Justice has informed North Carolina that it is violating federal law, that it could file a lawsuit to block the law and that the state could potentially lose millions in federal funds.
<br><br>
	49% oppose the Justice Department taking these actions while 28% support the Department.
<br><br>
	38% say that state governments should pass no laws at all on this issue. 22% say state governments should pass laws preventing transgender people from using public restrooms that match the gender with which they identify. 19% say that states should pass laws allowing transgender people to use public restrooms that match the gender with which they identify.
<br><br>
	39% say they personally know or work with someone who is transgender. 59% say they do not know a transgender person. (This number may be overstated as compared to when people are asked if they really know a transgender person.)
