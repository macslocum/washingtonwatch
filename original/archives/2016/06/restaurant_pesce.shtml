<h1>Pesce</h1>
2002 P Street NW<br>
Washington, DC 20036<br>
202-466-3474</div>Debbie and I went to Pesce for the first time with Bev and Brady.  Frankly, as many times as I have driven down “P” Street I’ve never noticed the restaurant even though it has been on this block for 20 years. 
<br><br>
There are four steps up to the main restaurant level. The restaurant is longer than it is wide and seats 75 people including 10 people at the bar. The bar sits about two-thirds of the way back into the restaurant and includes many 2s and 4s. 
<br><br>
Even when full of diners you can still have a conversation without shouting and without sharing it with the next table. 
<br><br>
Pesce is primarily a seafood restaurant which offers a full range of seafood from sardines to octopus to tuna to salmon. There is also a selection of salads and at least one soup a night. 
<br><br>
The menus are hand-written each day and presented table side on chalkboards. The offerings vary from time to time. The night we were there a veal chop was on the menu.
<br><br>
Bev started with a Caesar salad followed by Lobster Risotto. Debbie started with Tuna Tartare followed by Pasta with Clams. Brady had Oysters on the ½ shell followed by the Veal Tonatto (a veal chop topped with tuna tonatto). I started with the grilled Calamari followed by a grilled Lobster. 
<br><br>
For dessert we shared a Chocolate Tart and Pecan and Apple Tart.
<br><br>
There is something about the atmosphere of the restaurant that makes it quite comfortable and friendly.
<br><br>
About the men’s room, it is located at the back of the restaurant across from the women’s room. The two rooms are about five steps up from the main restaurant floor. There is a sign posted on the men’s room door that says “Dear Patron, Men’s room doorknob does not lock. Please lock latch behind you. Thank You management.” The door is easily latched from inside.
 <br><br>
Immediately to the right is a wash basin in a tan marble top.  The floor is a series of black and white squares and rectangles. The walls are covered with square tan tiles several inches wide.
<br><br>
There is a standard white ceramic commode and, interestingly, there is a table with a white cloth straddling the urinal. My assumption was that it is not operable. The men’s room is generally a bit run down but clean enough. 
 <br><br>
Valet parking is available in the evening. The valets also services Al Tiramisu.
<br><br>
Hours: 11:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. (10:30 p.m. on Fri & Sat)
