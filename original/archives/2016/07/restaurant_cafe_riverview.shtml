</div>Debbie introduced me to Café Riverview when we were in East Sandwich on Cape Cod. The café opened several years ago. As you would guess by its hours, they serve breakfast and lunch as well as a variety of pastries and non-alcoholic drinks.
<br><br>
The café is managed and run by the students from the Riverview school. Café Riverview is Riverview School’s hands-on-classroom.  Students who are interested in food service often work at Café Riverview where they learn about restaurant operations and how to prepare food and serve the public.  
<br><br>
Café Riverview is a very popular destination in Sandwich and the students thrive on being a vital part of its success. Many of the students who work at the Café ultimately find work in the food service industry. (See note at end of this review.)
<br><br>
	 Inside there are six seats at a counter and twenty-five seats with tables in a dining area. In good/warm weather there is seating for sixteen on the front porch.
<br><br>
There are a wide variety of customers of all ages from the local and folks who may be passing through.
 <br><br>
	Breakfasts include a variety of choices ranging from Spicy Burritos to a Morning View Breakfast Sandwich of sliced ham, egg, cheddar cheese and caramelized onion on a toasted Portuguese muffin. There is also Oatmeal with Wheat Berries and Hot Quinoa with Almonds. They also offer a number of Egg and Cheese Sandwiches with additions ranging from Baby Spinach to Chives.
<br><br>
	As lunch time approaches there a number of sandwiches and salads. The sandwiches range from Cape Cod Cranberry Chicken Salad to a Chicken Pesto Ciabatta.  The salads range from a Caprese Salad to Asian Chicken with Almonds.
<br><br>
	From the beginning the question was whether the café would sustain itself financially or would it require a continuing stipend. The café is now financially self-sustaining.
<br><br>
	There is a unisex bathroom.
<br><br>
	If you are on the Cape give it a try.
<br><br>
Note: Riverview School, an independent coeducational boarding/day school, provides a caring community for students ages 11-22 with complex language, learning and cognitive challenges. The School is committed to developing student competence in academic, social and independent living skills.
