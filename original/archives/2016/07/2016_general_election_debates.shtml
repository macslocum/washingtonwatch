<p></p>
The schedule of debates previously announced by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has been changed.  Wright University of Ohio, which was scheduled to host the first presidential debate, has withdrawn apparently because of the financial cost of hosting the debate. It has been replaced by Hofstra University. Hofstra had agreed to be the alternative last year. This will be the 3rd consecutive presidential election in which Hofstra has hosted a presidential debate. 
<br><br>
The open question is whether Trump will decide not to participate in all three presidential debates.
