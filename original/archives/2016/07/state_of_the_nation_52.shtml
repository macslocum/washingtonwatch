18% of Americans say the country is headed in the right direction while 73%  say it is on the wrong track. (NBC/WSJ 7/9-13/16)  The ABC/WP and CBS/NYT surveys taken at roughly the same time are slightly more optimistic with right direction scores of 28% and 26% respectively.
<br><br>
	Let’s take a look at the “official” unemployment numbers.
<br><br>
	The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for June 2016 is 4.9%, up from 4.7% last month.
<br><br>
	If one takes into account the total number of unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is 9.6%.  [BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]
<br><br>
	The unemployment rate for adult women and men was 4.5%; 4.4% for whites, 8.6% for blacks, 3.5% for Asians, and 5.8% for Hispanics.
<br><br>	
	In the first week of July, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 5.3%. It also found an under-employment rate of 13.3% (unemployed + those working part-time but wanting full-time).  [This is based on those 18 years of age and older.]

	People in the U.S. go to the emergency room more than you might think. 20% of people in the U.S. head to the ER at least once each year, according to new numbers out from the CDC. That translates to about 131 million ER visits a year, 11% of which result in a patient being admitted to the hospital. Visits in the five most populous states — New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois – accounted for 36% of all ER visits nationwide. [STAT, 6/24/16]

	74% of Americans think that race relations in the United States are either fairly or very bad. This is the highest number found in the eleven times this question has been asked since 1994. Among whites, 75% think race relations are very or fairly bad and among African Americans the fairly/very bad number is 76%. 70% of Hispanics share the fairly/very bad view. [NBC/WSJ 7/13]

<br><br>
	The pessimism expressed in the two surveys noted above is reinforced by the finding in the WP/ABC survey (7/14) that 63% of respondents believe that race relations in this country are generally bad. 72% of African Americans share this view as do 63% of white Americans.

<h2>Who is Poor In The United States</h2>

By: Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, Lauren Bauer and Ryan Nunn  (Brookings, 6/17/16)
<br><br>
The following are excerpts from <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2016/06/17-who-is-poor-in-the-united-states-schanzenbach-bauer-nunn">this article</a>.

<blockquote>
46.7 million Americans—14.8 percent of the population…lived in poverty in 2014.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> More than a third of those who live in poverty are children. More than 15.5 million children lived in poverty in 2014.</li> 
<li> About 13 percent of those living in poverty are senior citizens or retired.</li> 
<li> A quarter of those who live in poverty are in the labor force—that is, working or seeking employment.</li> 
<li> A tenth of those in poverty are disabled.</li> 
<li> Eight percent of those living in poverty are caregivers, meaning that they report caring for children or family.</li> 
<li> Students, either full- or part-time, make up another seven percent of those living in poverty.</li> 
<li> Just three percent of those living in poverty are working-age adults who do not fall into one of these categories—that is, they are not in the labor force, not disabled, and not a student, caregiver, or retired.</li> 
</ul>

Just over half of those who live in poverty are of working-age, defined as between the ages of 18 and 64.

<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 13 percent are full-time, year-round workers, meaning that they usually worked 35 hours or more per week for at least 50 weeks during 2014.</li>
<li> Just over one quarter of poor working-age adults work less than full-time year-round, meaning that they worked during the previous year, but not on a full-time, full-year schedule.</li>
<li>  5 percent report that they are seeking employment – a classification that means that these adults were in the labor force – throughout the year.</li>
</ul>

The remaining 55 percent of working-age adults are not in the labor force.<br><br>
<ul>
<li> 18 percent —a third of the non-workers living in poverty—are disabled.</li>
<li> 26 percent—just under half of non-workers—are caregivers or students.</li>
<li> 6 percent are retired, though it is important to note that only the working-age population is considered here, so this constitutes early retirement.</li>
<li> 5 percent of the total population of working-age adults in poverty are not in the labor force and are neither disabled, a caregiver, a student, nor retired.</li>
</ul>

Though 13 percent of working-age adults living in poverty are working full-time year-round, about twice as many were employed less than full-time year-round in 2014. 
<br><br>
About 40 percent of those working part-time during the year are involuntarily part-time – meaning that they would like to work full time but cannot due to an economic reason such as inability to find a full-time job, employer reduction of hours, or slack work. Just under half of part-time workers were students, caregivers, or disabled. Only about 1 in 6 of these part-time workers worked fewer than 35 hours a week or less than 50 weeks a year for some other reason.

WW has not previously recommended the entirety of an article but I encourage you to read "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/">How American Politics Went Insane</a>" in the July/August 2016 issue of The Atlantic, by Jonathan Rauch. The following are a few excerpts:

<blockquote>
“Yes, the political future I’ve described is unreal. But it is also a linear 	extrapolation of several trends on vivid display right now. Astonishingly, the 	2016 Republican 	presidential race has been dominated by a candidate who 	is not, in any meaningful sense, a Republican. According to 	registration 	records, since 1987 Donald Trump has been a Republican, then 	an 	independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican, then “I do not wish to 	enroll in a party,” then a Republican; he has donated to both parties; he has 	shown loyalty to and affinity for neither. The second-place candidate, 	Republican Senator Ted Cruz, built his brand by tearing down his 	party; 	slurring the Senate Republican leader, railing against the Republican 	establishment, and closing the government as a 	career move.”
<br><br>
	“The Republicans’ noisy breakdown has been echoed eerily, albeit less 	loudly, on the Democratic side, where, after the early primaries, one of the 	two remaining contestants for the nomination was not, in any 	meaningful 	sense, a Democrat. Senator Bernie Sanders 	was an independent who 	switched to nominal Democratic affiliation on the day he 	filed 	for the New 	Hampshire primary, only three months before that 	election. He surged into 	second place by winning independents while losing Democrats. If it had 	been up to 	Democrats to choose their party’s nominee, Sanders’s bid 	would have collapsed after Super Tuesday. In their various ways, Trump, 	Cruz, and Sanders are demonstrating a new 	principle: The political parties 	no longer have either intelligible boundaries 	or enforceable norms, and, as a 	result, renegade political behavior pays.”
</blockquote>

<div align="center">*****</div>

<blockquote>
“And here is the still bigger point: The very term <em>party leaders</em> has become 	an anachronism. Although Capitol Hill and the campaign trail are miles 	apart, the breakdown in order in both places reflects the underlying reality 	that there no longer is any such thing as a party leader. There are only 	individual actors, pursuing their own political interests and ideological 	missions willy-nilly, like excited gas molecules in an overheated balloon.”
</blockquote>

<div align="center">*****</div>

<blockquote>
“Chaos syndrome is a chronic decline in the political system’s capacity for 	self-	organization. It begins with the weakening of the institutions and 	brokers—political 	parties, career politicians, and congressional leaders and 	committees—that have 	historically held politicians accountable to one 	another and prevented everyone in the system from pursuing naked 	self-	interest all the time. As these intermediaries’ influence 	fades, politicians, 	activists, and voters all become more individualistic and 	unaccountable. 	The system atomizes. Chaos becomes the new normal—both 	in 	campaigns and in the government itself.”

The following are excerpts from a Charlie Cook National Journal Column as published in the <a href="http://cookpolitical.com/story/9721">Cook Political Report 6/27/16</a>.

<blockquote>
"This race is about shifts in the electorate that have prompted voters to behave in ways they never have before."
</blockquote>
<div align="center" style="clear: both;">*****</div>
<blockquote>
"Both of our two major political parties are becoming far more ideological than they were in the past. The Democratic Party, once center-left, is now emphatically Left. The Republican Party, historically center-right is now emphatically Right."
</blockquote>
<div align="center" style="clear: both;">*****</div>
<blockquote>
"The economy has changed just as dramatically. Globalization, automation, productivity gains and technological advances, among other things, created new winners and losers almost overnight. The losers were often people who had skills that served them well in the 20th century but had fewer applications in the 21st century. The people left behind are scared and angry. Many of them are working-class voters without college degrees, and they form the backbone of the Trump movement."
</blockquote>
<div align="center" style="clear: both;">*****</div>
<blockquote>
"The fight over immigration is partly related to jobs and the economy. But it also reflects a split between people who embrace multiculturalism and see immigration as freshening the lifeblood of the country, and other people who are uncomfortable with the new arrivals and feel our culture is under siege.
	<br><br>
At the same time, the political culture wars have heated up. Abortion, guns, gay marriage, and bathroom policies at schools have created deep emotional cleavages in the country. The opposing camps are so entrenched that compromise seems impossible.
	<br><br>	
The quirky personalities who have walked on stage during this campaign season often blind us to the societal unease we are experiencing. It would be a mistake to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of various candidates without recognizing the underlying forces at workand trying to figure out where they might lead."

<h2>Breaking Government Gridlock: America’s Birthday Challenge</h2>

The following are excerpts from a <a href="https://www.atkearney.com/america250/breaking-government-gridlock">piece</a> written by Peter Hart and Dan McGinn.

<blockquote>
“The story of America is the story of hope over despair and unity over 	division. Countless political, social and economic disruptions have 	threatened to divide the nation and destroy our remarkable system of 	government. But Americans have always persevered.”
	<br><br>
	“First, the public has lost faith in the core institutions upon which our 	government and our economy are based”
	<br><br>
	“Second, the shift in the political system away from populism and 	greater participation, which defined much of the 20th century, toward 	the 	commanding influence of Super PACs, billionaire operatives and 	ultra-influential special interests, has undermined the essence of our 	representative democracy.”
	<br><br>
	“Third, the disappearance of competitive congressional districts should 	alarm everyone who believes in the importance of a government that is 	respected and valued.”
	<br><br>
“The consequence of these three forces is gridlock, declining trust and a 	yearning among the general public for something radical to shake up the 	system.” 
	<br><br>
	“If both parties remain fixed on an all-or-nothing approach, ‘We the People’ 	will see to it that the system is radically changed.”

This belief cuts across almost every demographic group: • 84% of Republicans • 80% of Independents • 74% of Democrats • 87% of conservative Republicans • 68% of African-Americans • 82% of Hispanics • 85% of conservatives • 76% of moderates • 77% of liberals • 79% of men • 80% of women”

	Remember the dust up over the role of the Super Delegates in the Democratic primary process? Well, the platform fight leading up to the convention is likely to result in a change. 
<br><br>
	After a protracted debate during the platform committee deliberations, a “unity commission” will be created with one of its goals being to review the role of the Super Delegates well before the 2020 election.
<br><br>
	It sounds like members of Congress, governors and distinguished party leaders will remain “unpledged and free to support their nominee of choice.”  The balance of the super delegates will be “apportioned and required to cast their vote at the convention in proportion to the vote received by each candidate in their state.”
<br><br>
	Further, it appears likely that participation in the primaries or caucuses will be broadened as to who may participate. [Washington Post, 7/23]
