First, let’s take a look at the “official” official unemployment numbers.
<br><br>
The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for March 2016 is <strong>5%</strong>, the same as November 2015.
<br><br>
However, if one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the current rate is <strong>9.8%</strong>. [BLS data is based on those 16 years of age and older.]
<br><br>
In the first week of April, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 5.6%. It also found an under-employment rate (unemployed +those working part- time but wanting full time) of 14.1%. [This is based on those 18 years of age
and older.
