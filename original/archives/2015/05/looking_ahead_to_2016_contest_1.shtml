					<h3><a href="#">Looking Ahead to 2016 – Contest for President</a></h3>

<p></p>
The 2016 election seems “a long way off” or “just around the corner,” depending on your point of view.
<br><br>
If you are a sports fan, the election seems “a long way off,” given that before the 2016 election you will experience two World Series of baseball, one Super Bowl of football, and two National Basketball Association finals.
<br><br>
If you are not into sports, or even if you are, between now and the election there are over 550 bedtimes, wake-ups, breakfasts, lunches and dinners to be had; 4,400 hours of sleep; and over 13,200 hours of news on the 24-hour news channels.
<br><br>
If you are a political junky, the election might seem to be just around the corner, even though there will be 51 State primaries or caucuses, a number of candidate debates, and two national Party conventions before the election.
<br><br>
Between now and the 2016 election most of what we are sure about today will prove to be wrong. Things we have not even thought about today will become part of the reality of the election.
<br><br>
Each actual candidate will be called upon to explain actions or statements made at some point since they were born.
<br><br>
63% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans are satisfied with the choices they currently have in choosing their nominee. [NBC/WSJ 3/15]
<br><br>
The following chart is WW’s cut of the current list of real and potential candidates. Here is how I decided on the category placement for each actual and potential candidate, conceding at the outset that there is a whole lot of subjectivity in all but the “On the Field” category. (As always my views are colored by the assessments of a variety of professional pundits whom I respect: Cook, Rothenberg/Gonzales, Sabato, and other folks.)
<br><br>
<strong>On The Field</strong> – Candidate has filed with the Federal Election Commission; has announced that he or she is running; has announced that they are going to commence a formal candidacy; or has been particularly active in raising money or campaigning.
<br><br>
<strong>On the Bench</strong> – Individual has not gone so far as to be treated as “On the Field,” but is sounding off and making some moves.
<br><br>
<strong>In the Locker Room</strong> – Individual talking about running, but not all that active yet.
<br><br>
<strong>In the Grandstand</strong> – Individual has been mentioned as possible candidate with some regularity, but for one reason or another is not active.
<br><br>
Two Democrats in this category are different than the others. Vice President Joe Biden will quickly become a candidate of Hillary Clinton should falter. This is also the case with Secretary of State John Kerry.
<br><br>
<strong>Not at the Game</strong> – Individuals who have mentioned themselves or someone has mentioned them, but there is no obvious action.
<br><br>
<strong>Announced – Not Going to Play</strong> - These individuals have specifically made clear that they are not going to be candidates. But here too, should Clinton falter, the pressure on Warren would be enormous.
<br><br>
[* in the chart below signifies that the candidate/potential candidate has ties to a Super PAC. More often than not, these Super PACs are being run by persons who have more than marginal ties to these candidates. For a complete list of the PACs and the person to whom they are connected see WP 4/28/15, Page A4]

  Polling means very little at this early stage of the Presidential nominating process. Nonetheless, here is the Real Clear Politics average for the period 3/26/15 - 4/21/15 for the Republican contest.
    <br><br>
Bush 15.4% <br>
Walker 13.6 <br>
Rubio 10.6 <br>
Cruz 10.4 <br>
Paul 9.4 <br>
Huckabee 7.8 <br>
Carson 5.8 <br>
Christie 5.6<br>
Perry 2.4 <br>
Santorum 2.0 <br>
Kasich 1.8<br>
Jindal 1.3
  <br><br>
Unless something totally unexpected happens, the Democratic contest is all but over. Here are the RCP numbers over the same time period as above.
  <br><br>
Clinton 62.2 <br>
Warren 12.7 <br>
Biden 9.8 <br>
Sanders 5.6 <br>
O’Malley 1.6 <br>
Webb 1.4 <br>
Chafee .3
<br><br>
Clinton leads all potential opponents in RCP’s general election face-offs by margins ranging from 7.5 points against Rubio to 13.3 points against Carson.

In a recent Gallup survey (3/15), Democratic respondents were asked to express their favorable/unfavorable attitude about Hillary Clinton and a number of other potential Democratic candidates. It’s no surprise that Clinton, who was by far and away the best known, ranked considerably higher than the others.
<br><br>
WW did an analysis of this that may not be treated as particularly valid among those who are purists about data. For example, in the case of Clinton, 7% said they never heard of/have no opinion of her. So the denominator of the equation to determine favorability changes from 100% to 93%. Clinton’s favorability in the Gallup survey is 79%, and in the WW recalculated version it is 85%.
<br><br>
In the Gallup survey of favorability, Joe Biden he is known by 81% of the population, and his favorability is 64%. In the WW recalculated version it is 79%.
<br><br>
Elizabeth Warren is known by 53% of the population. Her favorability in Gallup is 37%. In the WW recalculated version it is 79%.

If Clinton is the nominee, which seems likely, and she is then elected president not only will she be the first woman elected to that office, but she will also be the first Democrat to succeed a two term Democratic incumbent in the office in the last 180 years. [Amy Walters]

If you want to be elected President of the United States you had better win your Party’s Iowa caucus and the South Carolina primary. Beginning with 1976 (as far back as WW looked), no person who was elected President failed to win both of these contests. New Hampshire, the first primary in the nation, does not have the same record. Over the same time period, in three of the election cycles, the ultimate winner of the Presidency did not win the New Hampshire primary: 1992, 2000, and 2008.
<br><br>
Here is the primary/nomination schedule as presently available.
<br><br>
Feb 1: Iowa caucuses
<br><br>
Feb 9: New Hampshire primary
<br><br>
Feb 20: Nevada caucuses
<br><br>
Feb 27: South Carolina primary
<br><br>
Feb. 23: Michigan (election law states that the primary should be held on the 4th Tues of Feb., but this might change)
<br><br>
All other States can hold their primaries any time between March 1 and the end of June, per Republican and Democratic National Committee guidelines.
<br><br>
The following is a tentative list (subject to change) of the remaining States.
<br><br>
<strong>March</strong>
<br><br>
1: Colorado caucuses, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, North Carolina
<br><br>
5: Louisiana
<br><br>
8: Alabama, Hawaii R caucuses, Mississippi, Ohio, Michigan
<br><br>
13: Puerto Rico
<br><br>
15: Florida, Illinois, Missouri
<br><br>
22: Arizona
<br><br>
<strong>April</strong>
<br><br>
5: Maryland, District of Columbia, Wisconsin
<br><br>
26: Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island
<br><br>
<strong>May</strong>
<br><br>

<br><br>
10: Nebraska, West Virginia 
<br><br>

<br><br>
24: Arkansas
<br><br>
<strong>June</strong>
<br><br>
