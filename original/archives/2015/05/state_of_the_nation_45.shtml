The official BLS unemployment rate for March 2015 is 5.5 %, showing no change from February. The rate is down 1.1% points from a year ago. If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the rate is 10.9 %. This is down from 11.0% in February 2015. 2.4% have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer, down from 2.6% in February, and down from 3.4% a year earlier.
<br><br>
In the third week of April (April 24), Gallup found an unemployment rate of 6.0%, down from 7.4% at the same time in 2014. It also found an under- employment rate (unemployed +those working part-time, but wanting full time) of 14.7%, down from 17.1% in April 2014.
<br><br>
In 2014, 8% of families included an unemployed person. This is down from 2013, when 9.6% of families included an unemployed person.

<br><br>
By 2060, the Hispanic population is expected to double to 128.8 million. One in three U.S. residents would be Hispanic. The black population would increase to 14.7% of the population, an increase from 13.1% in 2012. The Asian population is projected to more than double to 34.4 million. [U.S. Census Bureau]

60% of Americans believe that it is possible for a person to get ahead in the United States if he or she works hard. This is up 6 points from 2014.

The low point in this period came in 2012, when only 53% expressed satisfaction with the opportunity to get ahead. [Gallup 1/15]

The U.S. government itself is the number one problem facing the country today. This is according to participants of a recent Gallup survey in which 18% so identified the government.
