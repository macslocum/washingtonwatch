5100 MacArthur Blvd<br>
Washington DC 20016<br>

<a href="http://www.bistroquetdc.com">www.bistroquetdc.com</a></div>The two restaurants written about <a href="http://www.mikeswashingtonwatch.com/archives/washington_watch/no_139/">in this issue of WW</a> very much operate at opposite ends of the dining spectrum, from formal to informal, fancy to plain, and expensive to inexpensive. Yet, each in its own way offers an enjoyable dining experience.
<br><br>
Bistroquet is a relatively new restaurant on the site of what was for many years, Listrani’s.
<br><br>
Debbie, Tom and I had lunch there shortly after it opened, and we were underwhelmed.
<br><br>
Lee and I had dinner there a few days ago, and it was a totally different experience.
<br><br>
The restaurant has two rooms, with a total of just over 60 seats composed of 2 tops, 4 tops and potentially 6 tops.
<br><br>
There is also a carry-out and delivery menu, which is quite different from the in-restaurant menu; more about that later.
<br><br>
Lee started with Salad Maison followed by Confit de Canard. I started with a Pea Soup special, followed by the Cassoulet Maison, house-made cassoulet with lamb, port and duck confit. The size of the cassoulet was such that it could easily satisfy two people.
<br><br>
Appetizers run from $8 - $14 and entrees from $16 - $28.
<br><br>
As we were eating I noticed two people coming in. The man who was using a cane was having a difficult time navigating the several steps and landing that are part of the front entrance. A person standing near the back of the room who appeared to be a busboy, and who also was the delivery person, rushed to the front door to provide useful help.
<br><br>
The carry out/delivery menu includes six pizzas (medium/large), including the likes of a Stir Fried Vegetable offering with garlic, onion, fresh tomatoes, bell pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, olives, spinach and capers. There are five sandwiches, the likes of a Three Pork Sub with pork tenderloin, smoked ham, bacon with green salsa, lettuce, tomato and onion.
<br><br>
It appears from the carry-out menu that one can also order items from the regular in-restaurant menu for delivery.
<br><br>
Delivery is available within two miles of the restaurant, but not across the bridge.
<br><br>
Parking is generally available on the street.
