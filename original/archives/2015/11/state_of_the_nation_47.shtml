64% of respondents, 80% of whom were Republican or Democratic primary voters, say that the country is on the wrong track.  25% say the country is on the right track.  [NBC/WSJ 10/18/15]  The CBS/NYT poll showed almost the identical result, with 64% saying the country is on the wrong track and 26% saying the country is on the right track.  [CBS/NYT 10/25/15]

	The official BLS seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September 2015 is 5.1 %, the same as the previous month.  The rate is down from 5.9% one year ago.  If one takes into account the total unemployed + those marginally attached to the labor force + those working part-time who want full-time work, the rate is 10.0 %, down from 11.7% one year ago. 
<br><br>
  2.1% have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer, down from 2.8% a  year earlier.  [Based on those 16 years of age and older.]
<br><br>
	In the first week of October, Gallup found an unadjusted unemployment rate of 6.3%.  It also found an under-employment rate (unemployed +those working part-time but wanting full time) of 14.1%.  [Based on those 18 years of age and older.]

	Over the last 10 years, the number of American adults who use social networking sites has grown from 7% to 65%.  It’s no surprise that 90% of those 18-29 years of age use these sites, but so do 35% of those 65 years of age and older.  This is up from 2% in 2005.  [PEW 10/8/15]
