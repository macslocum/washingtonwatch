2.5 billion people have digital cameras.  More photos are now taken every two minutes than in all of the 19th century.  [The Second Machine Age – p. 126]

	Since the establishment of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1789, 160 people have been nominated to serve on the Court.  Of that number, 124 were confirmed, but 7 of those nominees declined to serve, so only 117 actually were seated.  Of the remaining nominees, no action was taken on 9; 3 were postponed; 12 were rejected; and 12 were withdrawn.  [United States Senate]

	Gallop has announced that it will not be doing horse-race polling during the current primary season.  It remains to be seen whether it will return to horse-race polling in the general election.  Gallup will continue to ask respondents how they feel about individual candidates.  This decision is fall-out from its 2012 experience, when Gallop’s results were particularly off the mark compared to most  of its competitors.
<br><br>
PEW has yet to do any horse-race polling in this election, but has not made any particular announcement about its plans. 
<br><br>
	There is generally some “concern about the accuracy of polling at a time when fewer people are reachable or willing to talk to pollsters.”
