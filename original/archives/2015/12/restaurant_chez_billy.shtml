<h1>Chez Billy</h1>
1039 31st St. N.W.<br>
Washington, D.C. 20007<br>
202-965-2684<br>
<a href="http://chezbillysud.com">chezbillysud.com</a></div>I went to Chez Billy with Debbie and Hilary.
<br><br>
The restaurant is fairly narrow and seats 50 people. By the front windows there are a couple of tables to the left as you enter. The main dining room is one step down. On the left there is a banquette that runs the length of the dining room, providing half of the seating for two and four tops. On the right side of the room there are also a series of two and four tops.
<br><br>
Debbie started with the PATE MAISON, country style pork pate with dried figs, Dijon mustard and cornichons. I ordered RILLETTES, smoked blue fish rillettes, horseradish, dill, crème fraiche, and trout roe. Hilary tried a taste of each of the things we ordered. (I finished only a part of the Rillettes and to my surprise, as we were preparing to leave, I was given a small bag which included the unused dish as well as some bread.)
<br><br>
For an entrée Hilary chose the LOUP DE MER, Mediterranean sea bass, fennel barigoule, cured olives, lemon, and parsley pistou. Debbie selected TRUITE GRENOBLOISE, sautéed trout, fennel puree, fingerling potatoes, baby carrots, and lemon-caper butter. I went for the CONFIT DE CANARD, pommes sarladaise, shiitakes, spinach, banyuls vinegar.
<br><br>
We all enjoyed the fine French bread that was delivered to the table early in the meal.
<br><br>
We ordered three desserts that were more or less shared. Debbie picked PARIS BREST (croissant dough wrapped around whipped cream); Hilary selected PLAT DE FROMAGE; and I chose DOME AU CHOCOLAT (as a chocolate lover, this is close to the top of the list, a real competition to the excellent chocolate dessert served in the Terrace Restaurant in the Kennedy Center.)
<br><br>
Greg was our serving person and we found him to be as good at his craft as any serving person in town.
<br><br>
At the far end of the restaurant there is a small bar on one side, which is primarily a service bar, but there seem to be a few places to sit. You walk through this area looking for the restrooms. I found that the restrooms are on the second floor of the building, so I had to skip the usual review
<br><br>
There is no parking made available by this restaurant. However, almost directly across from Chez Billy is the Capella Hotel, which does have parking services. Parking is $21, assuming space is available.
